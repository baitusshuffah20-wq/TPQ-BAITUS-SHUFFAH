# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the provided TypeScript module declaration for "midtrans-client" with respect exclusively to security vulnerabilities. The code appears to define typings/interfaces for usage with the Midtrans payment gateway client in a Node.js or TypeScript environment.

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Sensitive Key Exposure via Insecure Instantiation**

**Description:**  
Constructors for both `Snap` and `CoreApi` require `serverKey` and `clientKey` as options, which are likely sensitive credentials to the Midtrans service.

**Potential Risks:**

- **Hardcoded Keys:** If implementers instantiate these classes with hardcoded keys in source code, this may lead to credential leakage (e.g., through source control).
- **Insecure Storage:** No mechanisms are suggested or enforced (since this is just a declaration), possibly leading to reading keys from insecure sources (e.g., environment variables with insufficient protection).
- **Client-Side Exposure:** If this module is bundled for client-side usage, `serverKey` (which should remain secret) could be exposed in the browser, risking full account compromise.

**Mitigations:**

- Ensure keys are loaded at runtime from protected environments or secret management solutions.
- Validate that only `clientKey` is ever exposed to client-side code; `serverKey` must be strictly server-side.

### 2. **Lack of Parameter Validation Typings**

**Description:**  
Several methods are typed to receive parameters of type `any`, notably:

- `createTransaction(parameter: any)`
- `charge(parameter: any)`
- `capture(parameter: any)`
- `cardToken(parameter: any)`
- `refund(orderId: string, parameter?: any)`

**Potential Risks:**

- **Injection Attacks:** Lack of structure allows arbitrary data, which could lead to parameter pollution or even injection if lower layers are not robust.
- **Privilege Escalation or Abuse:** Unchecked input could be abused to supply values enabling privilege escalation or unauthorized operations via the API.

**Mitigations:**

- Define explicit, strong types for parameters to enforce validation and expected shapes.
- Employ server-side parameter validation as a mandatory layer.

### 3. **Information Leakage via Unrestricted Transaction Operations**

**Description:**  
The module exposes methods to get status, cancel, approve, deny, expire, and refund transactions by order ID, using `Promise<any>` as the return type.

**Potential Risks:**

- If access control is not enforced in implementation, a malicious user may use knowledge of an order ID to:
  - Query transaction status (information disclosure)
  - Cancel or approve transactions (privilege abuse)
  - Trigger refunds or reversals

**Mitigations:**

- Ensure all transaction-related methods are protected with strict authentication and authorization checks server-side.
- Avoid passing sensitive IDs or operations to untrusted client code.

---

### 4. **ServerKey Handling and Exposure**

**Description:**  
The same point as above regarding instantiating with `serverKey` and possible accidental client-side exposure or logging.

**Mitigations:**

- Never bundle or send `serverKey` to client.
- Audit logs to ensure sensitive values are not unintentionally logged.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Strongly Type API Parameters:**  
   Replace `any` types with well-defined interfaces.

2. **Key Management Guidelines:**  
   Document and enforce that serverKey is only used on trusted backend services.

3. **Access Control:**  
   Remind implementers to validate user permissions before performing any transaction operation.

4. **Environment Best Practices:**  
   Encourage use of environment variables and secret stores to avoid accidental disclosure.

## Conclusion

While this moduleâ€™s code is largely typings, it establishes a contract that could foster poor handling of sensitive credentials and unvalidated input if not handled with care. The primary vulnerabilities are related to sensitive key management and parameter handling. Proper use and server-side security controls are essential to mitigate these risks.

**NOTE:**  
Actual security also depends on concrete implementation, environment, and developer usage. Review all consumer code and deployment strategy for additional risks.
