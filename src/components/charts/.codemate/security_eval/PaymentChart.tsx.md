# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Reviewed

- The React component `PaymentChart` and various chart data generators.
- Use of `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2`.
- No external API calls, no direct DOM manipulation, and no user authentication/authorization logic.

---

## 1. **Untrusted Data in Chart Data**

### **Vulnerability**

All data (`data`, `payments`) fed to the chart and data generators are passed via props or function arguments, with no type- or content-validation (e.g., `any[]` accepted everywhere). If untrusted user data reaches these components, it could result in:

- **Prototype Pollution:** If `payments` contains malicious objects (e.g., { **proto**: { isAdmin: true } }) and a simple `for...in` or `Object.keys()` is used, it could pollute object prototypes. In this code, `reduce` is used with object literals, which means carefully crafted input could still manipulate global object state.
- **Chart.js XSS**: Chart.js warns about the potential for XSS via label text, tooltip callbacks, or dataset labels if data is not properly sanitized. If `title`, `labels`, `dataset.label` or other fields are attacker-controlled (e.g., containing `</script><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`), Chart.js may render such text in DOM elements or via HTML tooltips (if custom plugins are used).

### **Exploitation Example**

If `title`, `data.labels`, or anything surfaced in the chart, legend, or tooltip comes from an untrusted source and contains e.g. `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`, this could allow DOM-based XSS if Chart.js or any future customization renders as HTML.

### **Mitigation**

- **Validate/Sanitize input**: Sanitize all label, title, and dataset text to strip HTML and JavaScript before passing to Chart.js.
- **TypeScript Strictness**: Replace `any` with explicit type interfaces; validate object structure and value types.
- **Chart.js Config**: Double-check documentation for tooltip/legend rendering (Chart.js by default renders all text as plain text, but custom tooltip/legend plugins/renderers should escape HTML).

## 2. **Date Handling With Untrusted Data**

### **Vulnerability**

All date mapping uses `new Date(payment.paymentDate)`. Invalid date strings or objects can cause exceptions or `NaN` dates, which may result in DoS (denial of service; the app may crash or enter an error state).

### **Mitigation**

- Validate all incoming payment objects to ensure `paymentDate` fields are valid ISO date strings before using `new Date`.
- Handle invalid dates gracefully and exclude or sanitize them.

---

## 3. **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large or Malicious Data**

### **Vulnerability**

Supplying very large data arrays (hundreds of thousands of `payments`) can degrade performance and potentially crash the client browser.

- There are no explicit checks against excessive data size, abuse of data fields, or recursive objects.

### **Mitigation**

- Enforce maximum data size for charts.
- Consider deep-copying or validating incoming data, especially if sourced from API endpoints or user input.

---

## 4. **General: Type Safety and Input Trust**

All chart data assumes well-formed payments and chart data structures. Since TypeScript allows `any`, type confusion or prototype pollution remains a risk.

### **Mitigation**

- Do not use `any`; define strict interfaces for payment objects and chart data structures.
- Add runtime validation for structure and type.

---

## 5. **Potential Future Risks**

- If Chart.js or react-chartjs-2 plugins are configured to render or interpret HTML strings in tooltips/labels, these become potential XSS surfaces if user-supplied.
- If custom callbacks/plugins are added with dangerouslySetInnerHTML, XSS is trivially possible.

# **Summary Table**

| Vulnerability                | Risk Level | Affected Code                                | Recommendation                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unsafe Input (labels/titles) | Medium     | Chart label/title/dataset fields (untrusted) | Sanitize all input for text fields                        |
| Prototype Pollution          | Low        | All reducers using `{}` as accumulators      | Validate/sanitize incoming objects before property access |
| DoS (large/malformed data)   | Low        | Large `payments` arrays or invalid dates     | Size validation, handle parse errors                      |
| Date handling (invalid date) | Low        | `new Date(payment.paymentDate)`              | Check for valid date strings                              |
| Type Safety                  | Medium     | Widespread use of `any` in function inputs   | Define and enforce proper TypeScript interfaces           |

---

# **Recommendations**

1. **Input Validation:** Never trust incoming data. Validate and sanitize all props, especially anything used for chart labels, titles, or data values.
2. **Type Safety:** Replace all `any` types with strict, validated TypeScript interfaces.
3. **Data Size Controls:** Enforce limits on data array lengths.
4. **Defensive Coding:** Detect and gracefully handle bad input (e.g. invalid dates, unexpected object shapes).
5. **Sanitization for XSS:** If chart data might ever originate from untrusted sources (e.g. user input or unverified APIs), carefully sanitize all chart text fieldsâ€”even if Chart.js currently renders as plain text.
6. **Be cautious with Plugins:** When using Chart.js plugins or tooltip/legend renderers, ensure no user-controlled HTML is ever interpreted as markup.

---

**Summary:**  
_The given code is fairly safe for internal/controlled data usage, but becomes vulnerable if fed with untrusted or user-supplied data. The most significant risks relate to XSS via labels/titles and prototype pollution. Strong input validation, strict typing, and sanitization are necessary for secure production use._
