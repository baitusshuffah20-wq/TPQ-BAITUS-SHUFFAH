# Security Vulnerability Report

## Target Code

_React AttendanceChart Component and Related Attendance Data Generators_

---

## 1. **Unvalidated/Untrusted Data Handling**

**a. Prop Type `any` Used Extensively**

- The `AttendanceChart` component and data generator functions accept props and arguments (notably, `data: any`, `attendances: any[]`, `halaqahs: any[]`) with type `any`.
- **Risk:** This allows untrusted, potentially malicious objects or values to be injected and passed through the code without validation or type safety.
- **Impact:** Malicious or malformed data could cause:
  - Application errors/crashes.
  - Security bypasses or code execution if passed further into functions that expect specific shapes/attributes.
  - Unexpected rendering or logic that could be used for denial of service or information leakage.

**b. No Input Validation or Sanitization**

- Data passed to chart.js components (`<Bar>`, `<Line>`, `<Doughnut>`) isn't validated or sanitized.
- **Risk:** Arbitrary data structures injected could cause complications in rendering, or, depending on upstream libraries and their vulnerabilities, could be crafted to exploit JavaScript prototype pollution or similar issues.

---

## 2. **Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Risks**

**a. User-Supplied Titles Rendered in the Chart**

- Chart title is rendered directly from the incoming prop `title` and used as `text` in `Chart.js` title configuration.
- **Analysis:** As Chart.js is a canvas-based library (not DOM), simple XSS risk is limited; however:
  - If at any point, chart labels or titles are used in DOM context elsewhere (tooltips, legends, labels rendered in HTML, or plugins that expose HTML Tooltips), **XSS is possible**.
  - Custom plugins, downstream HTML renderers, or converting canvas to image with embedded unescaped input could expose XSS vectors.
- **Mitigation:** Do not trust `title` or `labels` values as safe. Validate/sanitize inputs and escape any output that ever reaches the DOM.

**b. Use of Labels from User Data**

- Chart datasets and labels are constructed from values present in user-supplied attendances, status, and halaqah objects (e.g., `status`, `halaqah.name`).
- If these fields are ever rendered in HTML or appear in tooltips that Chart.js (or a related plugin) renders as HTML, this is exploitable for XSS.
  - Chart.js tooltips are typically canvas only, but customizations may render HTML.
- **Specific fields at risk:** `attendance.status`, `halaqah.name`, etc.

---

## 3. **Prototype Pollution**

**a. Use of Direct Object Assignment on Untrusted Keys**

- In the reducer in `generateAttendanceStatusData`:
  ```js
  const statusCounts = attendances.reduce((acc, attendance) => {
    acc[attendance.status] = (acc[attendance.status] || 0) + 1;
    return acc;
  }, {});
  ```
- **Risk:** If `attendance.status` is attacker-controlled (e.g., `__proto__`, `constructor`, etc.), this is a classic JS prototype pollution vector.
- **Impact:** Prototype pollution can cause denial of service, privilege escalation, or logic corruption.

---

## 4. **Denial of Service or Performance Issues**

**a. No Limit on Data Volume**

- All attendance datasets are processed in-memory; there are no checks on array sizes.
- **Risk:** If an extremely large array is passed, this may result in server/client lag, memory exhaustion, or dropped requests.
- **Mitigation:** Sanitize and limit/validate input array lengths.

---

## 5. **Code Injection or Arbitrary Code Execution**

**a. Indirect via Third-Party Libraries**

- If user input is allowed to craft options/props/data for Chart.js (or react-chartjs-2), and those libraries have vulnerable callbacks, there is a risk of code injection.
- In this code, callbacks are defined locally (e.g., tooltip's label function), but if these callbacks were user-generated or if other Chart.js plugins with vulnerabilities are used, there could be injection issues.

---

## 6. **Information Disclosure**

**a. Labels May Expose Sensitive Info**

- If any personal or sensitive information is passed in attendances or halaqah objects (e.g., names, IDs), and used as chart labels, there's a risk of unintentional information disclosure.

## 7. **Summary Table**

| Vulnerability                       | Severity | Vector                                 | Mitigation             |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Untrusted Data Handling/`any` Props | Medium   | Malicious/malformed data               | Strict types, validate |
| XSS via labels/titles               | Medium   | User-supplied text in chart display    | Escape/sanitize input  |
| Prototype Pollution                 | High     | Untrusted object keys                  | Validate keys          |
| DoS via Large Data Sets             | Medium   | Large arrays                           | Limit input size       |
| Information Disclosure              | Medium   | Labels contain sensitive/personal info | Scrub input            |

---

## 8. **Immediate Recommendations**

- Enforce strong typing for all input props, forbidding `any` use for attendance and halaqah objects.
- Always sanitize and/or escape all user-supplied strings before rendering in chart titles, labels, or elsewhere.
- Never use user-controlled values as object keys without whitelisting or validation (e.g., check status only in allowed set: PRESENT/ABSENT/LATE/SICK/PERMISSION).
- Limit the size of processed input arrays and return error or warning on excess.
- Review third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities and usage patterns, especially in Chart.js and react-chartjs-2.

## 9. **Conclusion**

While the code leverages a canvas-based library (Chart.js), improper use of untrusted data (including as object keys, and for labels/titles) creates a non-trivial security risk, especially for prototype pollution, XSS (in some scenarios), and information disclosure. Input validation, sanitization, and stricter typing are essential to mitigate these issues.
