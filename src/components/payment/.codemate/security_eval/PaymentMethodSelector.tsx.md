# Security Vulnerability Report: PaymentMethodSelector Component

## Overview

This report analyzes the provided React (Next.js) PaymentMethodSelector component for **security vulnerabilities only**. The component is a client-side UI for choosing payment methods. It does not directly handle payments, but poor practices in client code can still introduce security risks (e.g., data exposure, XSS, or logical vulnerabilities exploitable in the browser).

---

## 1. Client-Side Only Policy

**Risk Identification:**  
The component is marked `"use client"` and is implemented fully client-side.

**Risk:**

- Payment data shown or selected client-side should never be trusted by backend systems, as it is subject to manipulation by users in the browser (e.g., tampering with fee, method, or amount via DevTools).
- No evidence that sensitive logic/data (e.g., fee calculation, min/max checks) are enforced on the backend.

**Recommendation:**

- Always validate all critical payment data (amount, method, gateway, limits, fees, etc.) on the server. Never trust any client input for payment processing or accounting.

---

## 2. Injection/XSS Vectors

**Risk Identification:**

- Uses only locally defined data, React components, and no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or rendering of untrusted/external content.

**Assessment:**

- No apparent XSS or injection vulnerabilities are present, provided that all descriptions and names (which are rendered directly in JSX) always originate from trusted, statically-defined objects (as seen here).

**Recommendation:**

- If payment methods are ever sourced dynamically (e.g., from an API or admin), **sanitize**/escape all dynamic content before rendering, to prevent XSS.

---

## 3. UI Logical/Phishing Risks

**Risk Identification:**

- The UI presents payment methods and labels ("PCI DSS", etc.) but does not perform the payment itself.
- Misleading UI, imprecise claims ("Pembayaran Aman... PCI DSS") may lull users into false trust if the actual network call is insecure.

**Risk:**

- UI notices alone do not guarantee security; ensure that the actual **payment submission** process and API requests made from this UI are encrypted and reach a PCI DSS-compliant backend.
- An attacker could inject malicious gateways or links if the payment method list were not hardcoded.

**Recommendation:**

- Never place trust/security signals in UI only; must verify on backend.
- If future versions allow payment method config via API (not hardcoded), validate/sanitize all such data.

---

## 4. Possible Information Disclosure

**Risk Identification:**

- Full list of available payment methods is embedded in the UI.
- Not displaying any **sensitive** user or transaction data in the component.

**Risk:**

- **Low**: No sensitive personal/user data is exposed. But, if payment methods are dynamic and contain credentials, keys, or URLs in their fields, these could unintentionally be exposed client-side.

**Recommendation:**

- Never embed secrets, API keys, or backend endpoints in client code.
- If dynamic methods, audit for confidential fields before sending to the client.

---

## 5. Fee and Amount Calculation Manipulation

**Risk Identification:**

- Fee and total calculations are performed client-side in JS.
- The `onSelect()` callback only provides the chosen method (no network/API call is shown).

**Risk:**

- If this selection is directly sent to the server/payment gateway for charging (using client-side calculated amounts/fees), a malicious user could alter the amount or fee before submission.

**Recommendation:**

- Revalidate amount, method, and fee logic on the backend before final payment. Never trust fee calculation from the frontend.

---

## 6. "onClick" Handlers and Navigation

**Risk Identification:**

- Only triggers simple JS callbacks and does not navigate the user to untrusted/external URLs.

**Assessment:**

- No immediate risk of client-side redirection, phishing, or window.open with user-controlled target.

---

## 7. Third-Party Libraries/Icons

**Risk Identification:**

- Uses only Lucide React icons, no untrusted/remote scripts.

**Assessment:**

- **Low** risk, ensure all third-party dependencies are from trusted sources and regularly updated.

---

## Conclusion

- **No direct XSS, injection, or data disclosure vulnerabilities** were found in the code provided.
- **Primary risk is trusting client-side validation/logic** for payment limits, fees, method selection â€“ all must be re-validated on the backend.
- If payment method content ever comes from an API/admin panel, **sanitize all text fields** before rendering.
- **UI-based "security" messages (PCI DSS, etc.) are insufficient** protections; ensure actual payment flows are secure and compliant.
- **Keep client code free of sensitive data** and secrets.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability      | Present | Details                                                             | Recommendation               |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| XSS / Injection    | No      | All rendered data is static/trusted                                 | Sanitize future dynamic data |
| Client-Side Trust  | Yes     | Client-side fee/amount/method logic is not enough                   | Always validate on backend   |
| Data Disclosure    | No\*    | No secrets/user data shown. \*Depends on future dynamic API sources | Never send keys/client-side  |
| UI Security Claims | Yes     | UI claims payment is safe, but does not enforce security            | Ensure backend is compliant  |
| Third-Party Risks  | No      | Lucide/react only.                                                  | Audit dependencies regularly |

## Final Notes

This code is **sound from a UI security perspective** given hardcoded local data, but **business/security logic for payments must always be enforced backend-side**. No severe UI code vulnerabilities were found.

**If client modifies payment methods or amounts, an attacker can submit arbitrary values. Rely on backend checks!**
