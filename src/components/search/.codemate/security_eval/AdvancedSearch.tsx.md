# Security Vulnerability Report

## Component: AdvancedSearch (React)

### **1. User Input Handling and Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

- **Observation:**
  - All user inputs (`filters.query` and others) are handled via React input elements and are set directly on state or used for filtering local (mock) results.
  - Search results are rendered directly from mock data objects, and the metadata is displayed as `value` (could technically be a malicious string).

- **CVE Type(s):**
  - **Reflected XSS** (if untrusted data is rendered HTML)
  - **Stored XSS** (if results were fetched from an API or DB containing untrusted data)

- **Assessment:**
  - Currently, all the displayed data is mock data.
  - However, if/when migrated to use real backend data, if any property (`title`, `subtitle`, `description`, `metadata`) contains user-injected HTML/JS, it could be rendered unescaped in JSX (e.g., `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, or string interpolation).
  - Currently, data is rendered as plain text in JSX, **so no direct XSS exists in this example**. **However**, if the metadata keys/values are not controlled and contain malicious scripts, risk can grow, especially if rendering methods change.
  - **Recommendation:** Always sanitize and/or escape any data from the backend before rendering. Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or only use with trusted data.

### **2. Insecure Construction of URLSearchParams**

- **Observation:**
  - The `performSearch` function creates a URLSearchParams object from user-controlled filters (e.g., `filters.query`).
- **CVE Type(s):**
  - **Injection Meta/Improper Input Validation (Potential Future Issue)**
- **Assessment:**
  - Currently, this is used for a mock API.
  - If this were to be sent to a real backend, malicious input could lead to attacks if the backend did not properly sanitize/search param values (e.g., SQLi, NoSQLi, or other parameter-tampering attacks).
  - **Recommendation:** On both frontend and backend, validate and sanitize all input. Ensure the backend does not interpret search param keys or values as code.

---

### **3. Exposing Potentially Sensitive Metadata in UI**

- **Observation:**
  - All key/value pairs from `result.metadata` are blindly displayed.
- **Assessment:**
  - While this is internal data at the moment, if future API responses contain sensitive data (user IDs, tokens, internal notes), they would be disclosed to the end user.
  - **Recommendation:** Either whitelist metadata keys to display, or sanitize/validate returned fields before rendering.

---

### **4. Export Functionality Security Placeholder**

- **Observation:**
  - `exportResults` is a stub, but the comment suggests future export to CSV/Excel.
- **CVE Type(s):**
  - **CSV/Excel Injection ("Formula Injection")**
- **Assessment:**
  - If exported data could be opened as a spreadsheet, values starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` can be interpreted as formulas, a vector for CSV injection.
  - **Recommendation:** When generating CSVs, prefix such fields with a single quote `'` or sanitize values.

---

### **5. Lack of Type Validation / Consistency for Result Metadata**

- **Observation:**
  - The `metadata` is typed as `Record<string, any>` and rendered unconditionally.
- **Assessment:**
  - This can allow for unanticipated data types or objects to be rendered. If someone's backend sends an object that, when coerced to string, exposes sensitive information, issues could arise.
  - **Recommendation:** Prefer explicit typing and validation of metadata fields, and only render whitelisted keys.

---

### **6. No CSRF/Authentication Context**

- **Observation:**
  - As a client component, there is no authentication or authorization check for endpoints (since network calls are currently mocked).
- **Assessment:**
  - **No CSRF vulnerabilities at present**, but when integrating with real endpoints, ensure protected APIs are used, proper tokens/credentials are sent, and that CSRF protections are in place.

---

### **7. Overly Broad Error Logging**

- **Observation:**
  - `catch (error) { console.error("Search error:", error); ... }`
- **Assessment:**
  - Logging raw error objects can leak sensitive error details in production environments.
  - **Recommendation:** Mask/log generic errors in production or sanitize error messages when logging.

## **Summary Table**

| Vulnerability                  | Current Exploitability       | Risk (Now) | Risk (Future Integration) | Recommendation                                        |

| CSV/Excel injection            | N/A (now), High (future)     | -          | High                      | Sanitize CSV output, especially for formula injection |
| Error message information leak | Not exploitable (now)        | Low        | Medium                    | Mask or sanitize logged errors                        |

## **Recommendations**

- **Anticipate future backend integration.** The code assumes all data is safe; add sanitization/validation for all rendered results.
- **When using user input for API requests,** validate and sanitize to prevent parameter-tampering and injection attacks.
- **Protect exports** from spreadsheet formula injection, and audit all metadata fields for PII/sensitive content before exposing.
- **Add error handling** that does not leak sensitive details in production builds.
- **Review all user-generated or backend-generated fields** for unsafe HTML/content injection risks.

---

**BOTTOM LINE:**  
**This code, as it stands (with mock data), exposes no direct vulnerabilities. However, integrating real APIs and user-generated data could introduce classic XSS, injection, and data leakage risks if not mitigated in advance.** Proactive input/output sanitization, metadata filtering, and secure export practices are recommended before moving to production.
