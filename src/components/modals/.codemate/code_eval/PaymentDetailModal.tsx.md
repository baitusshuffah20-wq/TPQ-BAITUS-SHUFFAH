# Code Review Report

## General Observations

- The modal component is generally well-structured and makes good use of composition.
- There are, however, some concerns regarding **type safety**, **prop usage**, **DRY/duplication**, and **performance/maintainability**.
- Some UI/UX and code maintainability suggestions are also included.

---

## Detailed Issues & Suggestions

### 1. Lack of Type Safety for Payment Prop

**Problem:**  
The `payment` prop is typed as `any`, which defeats the purpose of TypeScript. This opens up the risk of runtime errors.

**Suggestion:**  
Define a proper `Payment` interface.

```typescript
// Suggested interface (extend as needed)
interface Payment {
  id: string;
  santriName: string;
  amount: number | string;
  status: string;
  paymentType: string;
  paymentDate: string | Date;
  createdAt: string | Date;
  updatedAt: string | Date;
}
```

**Replace:**  
`payment: any;`  
**With:**  
`payment: Payment;`

---

### 2. Repetitive Date Parsing

**Problem:**  
Date parsing and formatting are repeated throughout the code, making it error-prone and difficult to change formatting globally.

**Suggestion:**  
Extract a utility function for formatting dates.

```typescript
const formatDate = (
  date: string | Date,
  options?: Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions,
) => new Date(date).toLocaleDateString("id-ID", options);
```

**Usage:**  
`{formatDate(payment.paymentDate)}`  
`{formatDate(payment.createdAt, { year: "numeric", ... })}`

---

### 3. Inconsistent Amount Handling (`parseFloat(payment.amount)`)

**Problem:**  
`parseFloat` is repeatedly used; this suggests that `amount` can be a string or number, but this is not ideal.

**Suggestion:**

- Prefer `amount` being always number in your `Payment` type. Only parse once at data ingestion.
- If you _must_ handle both string and number:

```typescript
const getAmount = (amount: string | number) => Number(amount) || 0;
```

**Usage:**  
`getAmount(payment.amount).toLocaleString("id-ID")`

---

### 4. Unused Export Button Functionality

**Problem:**  
Export button has no handler (`onClick`). For reusable and future-proof code, it should have a defined handler or be removed if unused.

**Suggestion:**

```typescript
<Button variant="outline" size="sm" onClick={handleExport}>
  <Download className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  Export
</Button>

// Define handleExport in the component (even if just a placeholder)
const handleExport = () => {
  // Implement export logic here
};
```

---

### 5. Possible Modal Closure by Click Outside/Escape

**Problem:**  
Modal does not close on click outside or ESC key, which is typical UX expectation.  
**[Optional, not an error, but for better UX]**

**Suggestion:**  
Add listeners for click outside or key press escape using `useEffect`.

---

### 6. Potential Problems with Strict Null/Undefined Checks

**Problem:**  
The check `if (!isOpen || !payment) return null;` will fail if `payment` is 0 or an empty object, possibly not the intent.

**Suggestion:**  
Use strict null check.

```typescript
if (!isOpen || payment == null) return null;
```

---

### 7. Button/Interaction Accessibility

**Problem:**  
Use semantic `<button>` for all buttons, ensure `aria-label` for icon buttons, improve accessibility compliance.

**Suggestion:**

```jsx
<button
  onClick={onClose}
  className="text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600 transition-colors"
  aria-label="Close"
>
  <X className="h-6 w-6" />
</button>
```

---

### 8. Redundant Duplication of Status Text/Icon

**Problem:**  
Status text and icon are fetched in multiple places in markup, leading to maintenance headaches.

**Suggestion:**  
Extract status rendering to a mini component or a helper function returning both icon + text.

---

### 9. Prop Drilling and Over-nesting

Not a direct code error here, but if the Modal grows further, consider splitting sections into subcomponents for maintainability.

---

## Summary of Critical Code Changes

**1. Payment type safety:**

```typescript
interface Payment { ... }
payment: Payment;
```

**2. Date formatting utility:**

```typescript
const formatDate = (
  date: string | Date,
  options?: Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions,
) => new Date(date).toLocaleDateString("id-ID", options);
```

**3. Amount utility:**

```typescript
const getAmount = (amount: string | number) => Number(amount) || 0;
```

**4. Export handler:**

```typescript
const handleExport = () => { /* logic */ }
<Button ... onClick={handleExport}>...</Button>
```

**5. Strict null check:**

```typescript
if (!isOpen || payment == null) return null;
```

**6. Button accessibility:**

```jsx
<button ... aria-label="Close"><X ... /></button>
```

---

## Additional Notes

- Consider using a **modal library** or extracting modal logic for handling focus trapping, animations, and closing behaviors.
- If Payment statuses/types are finite, use Enums.
- In a real system, always validate props (maybe use PropTypes for JS or zod/io-ts for runtime validation in TS).
- Avoid calling `parseFloat`/`Number` in render paths for performance.
