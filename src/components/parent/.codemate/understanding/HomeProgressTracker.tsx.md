# HomeProgressTracker Component â€” High-Level Documentation

## Overview

`HomeProgressTracker` is a React component designed to help parents and educators monitor, record, and manage a child's (Santri's) progress and activities at home. It provides a dashboard-like UI to view daily activities, target goals, and track progress using a combination of summary cards, lists, and tab-based navigation. The component leverages mock data for demonstration, but is structured for future API integration.
