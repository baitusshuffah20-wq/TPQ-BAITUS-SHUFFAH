# Security Vulnerability Report

## Codebase: `ParentCommunicationCenter` React Component

---

### **1. Lack of Output Encoding / XSS Risk**

#### **a) Rendering User-Supplied Content Directly**

- The code renders `message.subject`, `message.from`, and especially `message.content` directly in JSX.
- **Risk:** If any of these fields are ever controlled by end users (even in the future when data isn't fully mocked), unescaped output could lead to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities.
- **Lines:**
  ```jsx
  <h4 className="font-medium text-gray-900">{message.subject}</h4>
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2">Dari: {message.from} â€¢ {formatDate(message.sentAt)}</p>
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 line-clamp-2">{message.content}</p>
  ```
- **Recommendation:**
  - Always **sanitize** or **escape** output, especially `message.content` and other user-submitted fields.
  - If rendering rich text in the future (e.g., with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or markdown), enforce strict sanitation.

---

### **2. Missing Input Sanitization and Validation**

#### **a) User Message Sending**

- The `sendMessage` function directly takes the contents of the textarea and puts it into a message (`content: newMessage`) and displays it.
- **Risk:** If later these messages are sent to a backend or to other clients, invalid or malicious payloads (e.g., encoded scripts, excessively large messages) could be injected.
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Sanitize** and **validate** all user input before using or storing it.
  - Enforce **max length** checks on message content and subject.
  - Consider disallowing or escaping dangerous characters.

---

### **3. No Authorization/Authentication Logic**

#### **a) Hardcoded User Roles / Assumptions**

- The code assumes `"Orang Tua Ahmad"` (parent) as the sender in `sendMessage`; recipient is always `musyrifName`.
- **Risk:** If integrated with a backend or authentication context, improper mapping could allow privilege escalation or spoofing of messages.
- **Recommendation:**
  - When adding backend integration, enforce **strong authentication** and use values from a secure context for `from` and `fromRole`.
  - Do not allow clients to set arbitrary `from`/`fromRole` fields.

---

### **4. No Protection Against Denial of Service (DoS) via Message Flooding**

- **Observation:** The code permits sending an unlimited number of messages, with no rate limiting, input length checks, or content validation.
- **Risk:** A malicious user can flood the system with messages, causing UI lag or overwhelming backend if connected.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Implement **rate limiting** both on the client and server side.
  - Set **maximum allowed message size**.

---

### **5. Handling Attachments (Features Not Fully Implemented Yet)**

- There's a `Paperclip` button likely meant for file uploads, but attaching files is **not yet implemented**.
- **Risk:** Once implemented, if there is no file type/size/content-type restriction, malicious files/scripts could be uploaded and shared (XSS, malware, etc).
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Strictly validate and sanitize** all uploaded files (MIME type, file extension, virus scanning, size limits).
  - **Never serve attachments from the same domain without content-disposition headers**.

---

### **6. No CSRF or Anti-Abuse Considerations (No Backend Yet)**

- No backend API integration is present yet.
- When adding API communication (e.g., sending/saving/loading messages), you **must protect endpoints** with **authentication, CSRF tokens**, and **anti-abuse checks**.
- **Risk:** Absent CSRF/anti-abuse controls could allow unauthorized or automated abuse.

---

### **7. Information Disclosure in Errors**

```js
catch (error) {
  console.error("Error loading messages:", error);
  toast.error("Gagal memuat pesan");
}
```

- **Risk:** Excessive details in error messages can sometimes leak internal information (if later relayed to UI or remote logging).
- **Current implementation:** Only logs to console and shows generic error.
- **Recommendation:** **Never expose raw errors/messages to end users.**

## **Summary Table**

| Vulnerability                                        | Risk                    | Mitigation                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| XSS via unescaped outputs (`message.content`, etc)   | High                    | Sanitize/escape all outputs                         |
| Lack of input validation/sanitization                | High                    | Validate & sanitize user input, set max lengths     |
| Hardcoded roles, missing auth context                | Medium                  | Require secure auth context, server-side validation |
| No anti-abuse controls (rate limiting, message size) | Medium/High             | Enforce limits client- and server-side              |
| Attachment handling (future) - file upload risks     | High (when implemented) | Enforce strict file validation, storage, headers    |
| No CSRF or endpoint protection (future)              | Critical (for backend)  | Implement CSRF, authentication on API               |
| Info leakage in errors                               | Low (currently ok)      | Always show generic errors to user                  |

## **Action Items**

1. **Sanitize all outputs** that render user-controlled content in the UI.
2. **Validate and escape user input** (message content, subject, attachments).
3. **Enforce strong authentication/authorization** when integrating with real data.
4. **Add rate limiting and size restrictions** on messages.
5. When implementing attachments: **validate file types/sizes** and serve with proper security controls.
6. **Plan for CSRF and endpoint protection** in backend APIs.
7. **Audit future features for similar security issues** before deploying to production.

**NOTE:**  
While the current version uses only mock data, these vulnerabilities will become exploitable if the component receives live or user-supplied data or is integrated with backend services. All listed mitigations are necessary for any production environment.
