# Label Component (High-Level Documentation)

## Overview

This code defines a reusable `Label` component for React, built on top of the Radix UI `@radix-ui/react-label` primitive. It uses utility libraries for styling and class management, specifically `class-variance-authority` (cva) and a custom `cn` function. The component provides a consistent and accessible label with customizable styling for use in form elements.

---

## Key Features

- **Based on Radix Label:** Wraps Radix's accessible label primitive for reliable UI semantics and accessibility.
- **Styling Consistency:** Applies a baseline of text size, font, and state styles (like disabled appearance) using a cva styling definition.
- **Customizable:** Supports extending or overriding styles via the `className` prop.
- **Forward Ref Support:** Forwards refs to the Radix Label root, allowing it to interoperate with libraries or custom hooks needing ref access.
- **Variant Ready:** Built with type support for future styling variants (none are defined in the snippet, but support is in place).

---

## Usage

- **Import the `Label` component** and use it to label form elements, ensuring accessibility and a uniform style.
- **Pass props** as you would to the underlying Radix label, plus an optional `className` for additional customization.

---

## Example

```jsx
import { Label } from "@/components/label";

<Label htmlFor="email">Email Address</Label>
<input id="email" type="email" />
```

---

## Technologies Used

- **React + TypeScript:** Functional, typed component.
- **Radix UI:** Accessible, headless UI primitives.
- **class-variance-authority (cva):** Utility for managing complex class names with variants.
- **Custom `cn` function:** Helper for class name concatenation.

---

## Exports

- **Label:** The default export, ready for use throughout the app.

---

## Customization

- To extend base styles or add new variants, update the `labelVariants` with cva configuration.
- The component is ready for advanced usage (disable, modify, animate, etc.) through props and ref forwarding.
