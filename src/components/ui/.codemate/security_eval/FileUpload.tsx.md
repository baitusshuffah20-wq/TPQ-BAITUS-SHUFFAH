# Security Vulnerability Report for `FileUpload` Component

This report reviews the provided code for potential **security vulnerabilities only**.

---

## 1. Unsafe Handling of File Uploads

### Issue: No Client-side File Type Validation

- The `accept` prop allows setting accepted MIME types/extensions, but there is **no explicit file type validation in code**, only the UI hinting. Malicious users can bypass this limitation and upload executable or harmful files by manipulating the request.
- The only actual validation is file size. There is no guarantee on the actual content of the file.

**Risk:** Malicious file uploads (e.g. webshells, malware) may reach the server if the backend does not properly validate files.

**Remediation:**

- Implement explicit client-side validation for file types (check both extension and `type`), not just accept on Dropzone.
- Server-side: Always validate and sanitize files and their content types/extensions.

## 2. Insecure File Preview (`URL.createObjectURL`)

### Issue: Immediate Preview of Uploaded Files

Files, including images, are previewed using `URL.createObjectURL`. If an attacker uploads a crafted SVG (for example), it might execute JavaScript on preview depending on the browser, leading to a **cross-site scripting (XSS)** risk.

**Risk:** XSS via SVGs (e.g., `<img src="evil.svg">`) if a malicious file bypasses server/content-type checks.

**Remediation:**

- Do not allow untrusted SVG/image uploads or sanitize SVG files before previewing.
- For previews, limit to only trusted content types (e.g., PNG/JPEG), never raw SVG.
- Consider rendering SVG files as a download link, not displaying them inline.

## 3. Lack of Output Encoding (`uploadedFile.file.name` in HTML)

### Issue: Displaying Unescaped File Names

```jsx
<p className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900 truncate">
  {uploadedFile.file.name}
</p>
```

File names come directly from the local filesystem and may contain characters that, if rendered unsanitized and mishandled, could lead to XSS or HTML injection attacks.

**Risk:** File names containing HTML/JS code (e.g., `evil"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.jpg`) could potentially trigger XSS if not properly escaped.

**Remediation:**

- Ensure React's rendering engine escapes potentially harmful characters (default behavior). Be cautious if switching to dangerouslySetInnerHTML or using file names in attributes or elsewhere.

---

## 4. Weak Error Handling

### Issue: Direct Use of `alert()` for Error Reporting

- Errors (e.g., file too large) are passed to `alert()`. This can leak information about application internals if not carefully handled, and alert-based UX can be abused for phishing/"alert bombing".

**Risk:** Minor, but unpredictable error reporting may help malicious actors probe application behavior.

**Remediation:**

- Use consistent, sanitized, and user-friendly error messages.
- Do not include sensitive information in client-side errors.

---

## 5. Insecure or Improper Use of Fetch

### Issue: No CSRF or Authentication Handling

- The file upload fetch request (`fetch(uploadEndpoint, { method: "POST", body: formData })`) sends potentially sensitive files to a backend endpoint.
- There is **no evidence of CSRF protection**, authentication headers, or other credential handling.

**Risk:** If deployed in a sensitive context, the endpoint might be abused via CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) or by unauthenticated users.

**Remediation:**

- Ensure the backend requires authentication & uses CSRF protection.
- Consider using `credentials: 'include'` if session cookies are required.

---

## 6. Incomplete Clean-Up of Object URLs

### Issue: `URL.revokeObjectURL` is called for every file, **not just those being removed**.

In `removeFile`, the cleanup might unnecessarily revoke URLs used by files the user wants to keep, breaking previews and leading to potentially dangling memory allocations.

**Risk:** While not a direct security risk, improper object URL management could lead to leaking references or breaking application logic which may open secondary vulnerabilities.

**Remediation:**

- Only revoke object URLs for _removed_ files.
- Move `URL.revokeObjectURL` so it operates only on `fileToRemove` rather than every file.

---

## 7. Unrestricted Upload Endpoint

### Issue: Static, Public Upload Endpoint

The `uploadEndpoint` defaults to `/api/upload` and can be overridden by a prop. No checks on the URL format, protocol, or domain are performed on the client.

**Risk:**

- If upload endpoints are controlled by user input, a malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate files to an external endpoint by tricking the application into sending them to attacker-controlled URLs.

**Remediation:**

- Strictly control the upload endpoint on the client (never take it from user input).
- Validate endpoint (ideally hardcode or define serverside).

---

## 8. Lack of Rate Limiting & Quota

### Issue: No Client/Server Limiting

- Code enforces `maxFiles` per upload, but not per user/session/account.
- Malicious users may repeatedly trigger uploads.

**Risk:** May lead to denial-of-service, storage exhaustion, or unintended exposure.

**Remediation:**

- Rate limit and throttle client/server-side uploads.

## Recommendations

- **Validate all files on both client and server side.** Only accept safe file types/extensions. Use MIME sniffing on the backend.
- **Never trust the file name from the client** for any sensitive display, storage, or logic.
- **Do not render SVGs or other dangerous formats inline.** Allow previews for only strictly safe images (e.g., JPEG/PNG).
- **Protect your upload endpoints.** Require authentication, use CSRF tokens if necessary, and never permit uploads by anonymous or untrusted users.
- **Review error reporting flows.** Do not leak internal error information or confuse users with alert bombs.
- **Enforce storage quotas and/or rate limits on uploads.**
- **Clean up object URLs only as needed.**

---

**REMEMBER:**
The most important security checks for file uploads must happen server-side. The above concerns should be addressed in tandem with secure backend implementations.
