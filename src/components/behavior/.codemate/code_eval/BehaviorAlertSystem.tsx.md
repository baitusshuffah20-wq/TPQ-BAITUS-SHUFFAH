# Code Review Report

Below is a critical review based on industry standards for maintainability, performance, security, and correctness, as well as unoptimized or error-prone areas. Each issue is accompanied by a suggestion (with **pseudo code patch** as requested) for correction or improvement.

---

## 1. **State Initialization for Performance**

**Issue:** `mockAlerts` is redefined on every render. This is inefficient and against React best practice for static/mock data.  
**Suggestion:** Hoist outside of the component.  
**Pseudo Code Patch:**

```javascript
// Move the declaration OUTSIDE of the component function
const mockAlerts = [...]
```

---

## 2. **Dependency Array Error in `useEffect`**

**Issue:**  
`useEffect(() => { filterAlerts(); }, [alerts, selectedSeverity, selectedType, showResolved, searchTerm]);` — Here, `filterAlerts` is a function defined in the component, so it will be re-created on every render, potentially causing issues.  
**Suggestion:** Either define `filterAlerts` with `useCallback`, or simply do the filtering in a `useMemo` and deprecate the state variable `filteredAlerts`.

**Recommended (preferred pattern): useMemo for derived state.**  
**Pseudo Code Patch:**

```javascript
const filteredAlerts = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = alerts;
  // ...apply filters...
  return filtered;
}, [alerts, selectedSeverity, selectedType, showResolved, searchTerm]);
```

- Remove `filteredAlerts` state and the effect.
- Replace access with the variable above.

---

## 3. **Event Handlers and Propagation**

**Issue:**  
Inline functions in JSX, such as `onClick={() => markAsRead(alert.id)}`, lead to new function instances on every render and potentially unnecessary re-renders for deeply nested items.

**Suggestion:**  
Define stable callback functions using `useCallback` or move them out of the render body when possible if performance issues arise in large lists.  
**Pseudo Code Patch:**

```javascript
const handleMarkAsRead = useCallback((id) => markAsRead(id), [markAsRead]);
// Then, <Button onClick={() => handleMarkAsRead(alert.id)} ...>
```

---

## 4. **Incorrect Handling of Date Strings**

**Issue:**  
`createdAt.split("T")[0]` is fragile (could break if the string changes format).  
**Suggestion:**  
Use `new Date(alert.createdAt)` for parsing, and adjust formatting helpers to accept a `Date` object instead of string manipulation.

**Pseudo Code Patch:**

```javascript
// When calling format functions, pass Date objects
formatBehaviorDate(new Date(alert.createdAt));
// ... and similarly for resolvedAt:
formatBehaviorDate(alert.resolvedAt ? new Date(alert.resolvedAt) : null);
```

---

## 5. **Error Handling: Missing Error Boundary**

**Issue:**  
If a rendering or runtime error occurs, the entire modal will crash.  
**Suggestion:**  
Wrap with React Error Boundary component.

**Pseudo Code Patch:**

```javascript
<ErrorBoundary>{/* ...BehaviorAlertSystem JSX... */}</ErrorBoundary>
```

---

## 6. **Accessibility: Buttons Without `aria-label`**

**Issue:**  
Icon-only buttons like "close" do not have an aria-label—reducing accessibility for screen readers.  
**Suggestion:**  
Add `aria-label`.

**Pseudo Code Patch:**

```javascript
<button aria-label="Tutup Alert" ...>...</button>
```

---

## 7. **Scalability: Magic Numbers for Skeleton Loader**

**Issue:**  
Hardcoded `[1, 2, 3]` for loading skeletons is fragile.

**Suggestion:**  
Define as a constant or based on user viewport/preference.

**Pseudo Code Patch:**

```javascript
const SKELETON_COUNT = 3;
{Array.from({length: SKELETON_COUNT}).map((_, i) => (<div key={i} ... />))}
```

---

## 8. **Data Normalization for Filters**

**Issue:**  
When comparing enums/strings, casing errors or typos may cause runtime filter bugs.

**Suggestion:**  
Normalize inputs (e.g., `alert.severity.toUpperCase()`).

**Pseudo Code Patch:**

```javascript
if (selectedSeverity !== "all") {
  filtered = filtered.filter(
    (alert) => alert.severity.toUpperCase() === selectedSeverity,
  );
}
```

---

## 9. **Component Structure: Duplicated Conditional Classes**

**Issue:**  
Alert box `className` logic is deeply nested and hard to maintain.

**Suggestion:**  
Consider a helper function (for maintainability).

**Pseudo Code Patch:**

```javascript
function getAlertBoxClassName(alert) {
  if (alert.isResolved) return "border-gray-200 bg-gray-50";
  if (alert.severity === "CRITICAL") return "border-red-300 bg-red-50";
  // ...etc.
}
```

- Use: `className={`p-4 border rounded-lg ${getAlertBoxClassName(alert)}`}`

---

## 10. **Lack of Types in Event Handlers**

**Issue:**  
TypeScript types missing for event handlers (such as `e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`).  
**Suggestion:**  
Add explicit typings for clarity.

**Pseudo Code Patch:**

```typescript
onChange={(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
```

---

## 11. **Unused Imports**

**Issue:**  
Unused imports such as `Mail`, `Phone`, `Calendar`, `Filter` are present.

**Suggestion:**  
Remove dead imports.

**Pseudo Code Patch:**

```javascript
// Remove: import { Mail, Phone, Calendar, Filter } from "lucide-react";
```

---

## 12. **Security: Input Sanitization for Search**

**Issue:**  
While this is mock data, in production, ensure sanitization against XSS when interpolating user inputs.

**Suggestion:**  
Escape strings in production code.

---

## 13. **Prop Key Should be Unique (Long Term, if IDs Not Unique)**

**Issue:**  
If alerts could have duplicate ids, the key in `.map()` would be problematic.

**Suggestion:**  
As a rule: always ensure keys are unique.

---

## 14. **Separation of Concerns (Modularity)**

**Issue:**  
This function is too large (could be modularized by splitting AlertCard, AlertFilters, etc., into their own components for readability/testability).

**Suggestion:**  
Extract major blocks into separate components.

---

## 15. **Hardcoded Strings (Internationalization)**

**Issue:**  
UI strings are hardcoded; this hinders i18n.

**Suggestion:**  
Extract strings to a constants/i18n file.

---

## Summary

The above changes will improve maintainability, readability, performance, and future-proofing of your codebase.

### Example of a Corrected Snippet for useMemo Filtering:

```javascript
const filteredAlerts = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = alerts;
  if (selectedSeverity !== "all") {
    filtered = filtered.filter((a) => a.severity === selectedSeverity);
  }
  if (selectedType !== "all") {
    filtered = filtered.filter((a) => a.alertType === selectedType);
  }
  if (!showResolved) {
    filtered = filtered.filter((a) => !a.isResolved);
  }
  if (searchTerm) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(
      (a) =>
        a.santriName.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
        a.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
        a.message.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()),
    );
  }
  return filtered;
}, [alerts, selectedSeverity, selectedType, showResolved, searchTerm]);
```
