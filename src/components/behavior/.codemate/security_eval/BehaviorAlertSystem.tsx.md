# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Analyzed

React/NextJS functional component for a behavior alert system, written in TypeScript with UI components and local mock data.

---

## 1. **Lack of Input Sanitization**

#### Issue

- The `searchTerm` value is directly used to filter alerts by matching against the `santriName`, `title`, and `message` fields.
- If this code is refactored in the future to accept user-supplied data for alert properties (especially as mock data is replaced with backend data), the search feature could become sensitive to special character injection or RegExp DOS amplification.

#### Impact

- **Potential XSS Risk:** If `santriName`, `title`, or `message` ever originate from untrusted backend/user sources and are rendered without sanitization.
- **Potential ReDoS:** Complex, crafted input in `searchTerm` could cause inefficient search behavior if not properly handled (less severe with `includes` but can worsen if `.match()` or RegExp-based search is introduced).

#### Recommendation

- Always sanitize and escape data when rendering any kind of user-supplied input.
- If adding backend/DB data in the future, validate inputs and outputs for malicious content.
- Restrict or sanitize search inputs if switching to RegExp-based filtering.

---

## 2. **No Protection Against Clickjacking**

#### Issue

- The alert modal (`<div className="fixed inset-0...">`) can appear as an overlay for the entire application. There's no explicit mechanism to prevent the web app from being embedded in an iframe.

#### Impact

- **Clickjacking:** Attackers could embed the app in an iframe on a malicious site and trick users into clicking elements.

#### Recommendation

- Add server-side HTTP `X-Frame-Options: DENY` headers or equivalent Next.js/Express config.
- For pages/components that display sensitive data, explicitly enforce frame-busting logic if deployed as a web application.

---

## 3. **Mock Data and Disclosure Risks**

#### Issue

- The code currently uses mock data with real-sounding names and details. If this practice continues in production or code sharing, it might inadvertently reveal or "leak" confidential or personal information.

#### Impact

- **Information Disclosure:** Even mock data can reveal data structure, naming conventions, or potentially real data if not replaced.

#### Recommendation

- Ensure all mock data is anonymized or obfuscated in production and in shared code.
- Use generic placeholders.

---

## 4. **Unrestricted Alert Actions**

#### Issue

- Functions `markAsRead` and `resolveAlert` are invoked by UI elements with no authentication/authorization checks.
- In a real deployment, these mutations would hit an API and should be subject to user permission validation.

#### Impact

- **Privilege Escalation:** Without backend checks, any user could resolve or mark alerts as read (if client logic is replicated on backend).
- **Race Conditions:** No protection against multiple actions at once (though minor here).

#### Recommendation

- Never trust client-side state. Validate and authorize every action on the backend backend.
- Implement checks for user permissions and roles for mutating alert state.

---

## 5. **Unescaped User-Supplied Data in UI**

#### Issue

- Alert messages, names, and titles are rendered directly in UI components without escaping.

#### Impact

- If these properties ever originate from user input (backend data), this could enable stored XSS if someone enters HTML/JS payloads.

#### Recommendation

- Always escape and sanitize any untrusted data rendered in HTML, especially with dangerouslySetInnerHTML or similar scenarios.
- Prefer rendering as plain text wherever possible.

---

## 6. **No Audit Trail or Logging of Actions**

#### Issue

- Actions such as resolving or marking as read are not logged.

#### Impact

- Malicious or accidental actions are not traceable, making abuse harder to detect.
- Not a direct vulnerability, but an audit gap in most admin/alert systems.

#### Recommendation

- Log significant state-changing actions, server-side.
- Provide a history trail for all alerts and actions.

---

## 7. **UI Logic Trusted for Data Integrity**

#### Issue

- All filtering, mutations, and UI state live entirely on the frontend.
- This is acceptable for mock/demo, but should never be the final pattern.

#### Impact

- **Tampering:** Disabling UI elements in the browser can defeat any security barriers.
- **Data Integrity:** Malicious users can arbitrarily mutate client state.

#### Recommendation

- All sensitive data and actions must be validated/enforced server-side, not just in JS.

---

## 8. **No Rate Limiting or Abuse Controls**

#### Issue

- UI components (buttons) could trigger repeated alert actions (reading/resolving) very quickly, especially if later hooked to real API endpoints.

#### Impact

- Potential for abuse or denial of service if exposed endpoints lack rate limiting.

#### Recommendation

- Apply rate limiting and abuse monitoring to backend alert APIs.

# Final Notes

- **Current code does not persist or externally fetch data. Security vulnerabilities will become critical when backend integration is implemented.**
- **Address these now to avoid accidents and codebase pollution ("secure by design").**
- **Review security upon transitioning out of mock/demo phase.**
