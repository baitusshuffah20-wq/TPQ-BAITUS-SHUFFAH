# Security Vulnerability Report

## Codebase: ProgressTrackingDashboard Component

---

### **1. Mock Data Usage and Absence of Real API Calls**

**Risk:** _None in mock usage; real data scenario could introduce vulnerabilities._

- The code uses `mockGoal` and `mockActivities` for data. In a real application, data would come from external APIs. No API calls or data fetching from external sources are implemented here, so no immediate injection or data-leak vectors exist in this static setup.
- **No direct vulnerability but:**
  - When integrating with real APIs, always validate and sanitize responses.

---

### **2. User Input Handling (Evidence, Feedback, Notes)**

- Text inputs for "Bukti Penyelesaian" (Evidence), Musyrif Notes, and Parent Feedback are accepted via controlled components and set into React state.

#### **Potential Vulnerabilities:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - **Evidence:**
    - `milestone.evidence` is rendered without sanitization:
      ```jsx
      {
        milestone.evidence && (
          <div className="...">
            <strong>Bukti:</strong> {milestone.evidence}
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```
    - **Impact:** If user-supplied evidence contains HTML/script, and your rendering environment doesn't automatically escape injected strings (as React typically does), there's a risk of XSS. However, React **does escape** string output by default, so direct XSS via curly braces is prevented. This holds **unless** you introduce `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in the future.
  - **Notes & Feedback:** Same applies for `musyrifNotes` and `parentFeedback`:

    ```jsx
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">
      {goal.musyrifNotes}
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">
      {goal.parentFeedback}
    </p>
    ```

  - **Mitigation:** Ensure you **never** render user strings as HTML (with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) unless they are sanitized. Be wary if you later change to a markdown/html output.

---

### **3. No Input Validation or Sanitization**

- When saving feedback or notes:
  ```js
  const addParentFeedback = (feedback: string) => {...}
  const addMusyrifNote = (note: string) => {...}
  ```
- **Risk:** Strings are accepted and stored, but not validated or sanitized.
- **Impact:** In a full application with data persistence (API/database), this could facilitate:
  - **Stored XSS** — If another page/view renders this input unsafely.
  - **Content spoofing/formatting attacks**, particularly if these strings are used in emails, notifications, or logs.

- **Mitigation:**
  - Restrict input length/format as appropriate.
  - Sanitize inputs before storing or before outputting them in a context where HTML is parsed.

---

### **4. Lack of Authentication/Authorization**

- **Observation:** No checks are performed to confirm if the user is authenticated or is authorized to view/modify this goal data.
- **Impact:** In a real application, any unauthenticated or unauthorized user could potentially invoke functions like `completeMilestone`, `addParentFeedback`, or `addMusyrifNote`.
- **Mitigation:** Implement role-based access control and authentication checks on both client and server.

---

### **5. Information Disclosure in UI**

- This dashboard shows all recent activities, milestones, and personal feedback, which could be sensitive.
- **Risk:** Without proper user access validation, sensitive student or feedback data might be exposed.
- **Mitigation:** Ensure UI only displays data the logged-in user is allowed to see.

---

### **6. No Rate Limiting / Abuse Controls**

- **Observation:** Repeatedly calling the feedback or milestone completion functions (e.g., spamming "Selesaikan") could cause undesired effects.
- **Mitigation:** Backend endpoints (when integrated) should implement rate-limiting, and the UI could disable buttons while awaiting completion.

---

### **7. Client-Side Only Controls**

- **Risk:** All state and logic is handled client-side. In a production scenario, this is insufficient — malicious users can manipulate state and invoke setters directly.
- **Impact:** Without server-side checks, milestones/goals can be manipulated, and spam/forged feedback can be injected.
- **Mitigation:** All sensitive state changes (goal/milestone completion, feedback submission) should go through server APIs which authenticate and validate the operation.

### **Summary Table**

| Vulnerability        | Risk Level | Present?  | Mitigation                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| XSS (Evidence/Notes) | Medium     | Potential | String output ok in React; cross-check if later HTML output |
| No Validation        | Medium     | Present   | Validate & sanitize user input                              |
| Access Control       | High       | Lacking   | Implement user authZ/authN, role checks on server           |
| Rate Limiting        | Medium     | Missing   | Backend rate limits, UI debouncing                          |
| Info Disclosure      | High       | Potential | Display only data current user can access                   |

## **Recommendations**

1. **DO NOT** render user input as HTML/JSX without sanitization (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`).
2. **ALWAYS** validate and sanitize user input server-side and client-side.
3. **INTEGRATE** authentication and authorization checks for all sensitive UI and API operations.
4. **DESIGN** backend endpoints to enforce all business logic, not the client.
5. **RESTRICT** sensitive data exposure on the frontend to authorized users only.

> **NOTE:** The provided code, as is, with only mock data and no API communication, does **not** exhibit serious exploitation vectors in its current form, but **these issues become critical** as soon as real user input and external data persistence are introduced.
