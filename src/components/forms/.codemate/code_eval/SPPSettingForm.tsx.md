# Code Review Report

This code review analyzes the given React component based on:

- **Industry best practices**
- **Correctness and potential bugs**
- **Performance and optimization issues**
- **Consistency and code style**

Below, I document observations, identified issues, and recommendations. **Code suggestions are in pseudo code format, per request.**

---

## 1. **Component Initialization and Defaults**

### Observation

- The state `formData` is initialized by spreading `sppSetting` but also overwrites individual fields with fallback default values.
- This can lead to inconsistent/default overriding if `sppSetting` includes extra or unexpected props.

#### **Recommendation**

- Use explicit field assignments when initializing with optional props, to avoid unintended overrides.

##### Suggested change

```
// Remove ...sppSetting from setFormData initialization
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: sppSetting?.name || "",
    amount: sppSetting?.amount || 0,
    description: sppSetting?.description || "",
    isActive: sppSetting?.isActive ?? true,
    level: sppSetting?.level || "",
    id: sppSetting?.id // If you want to keep id
});
```

---

## 2. **Form Validation (Strictness)**

### Observation

- The `amount` validation might fail for user input such as string `"0"` or an empty string, causing incorrect error messages.
- `parseFloat(value) || 0` in handleChange will set `amount` to 0, so validation for strictly greater than 0 is appropriate.

### Recommendation

- Ensure type conversion is robust.

##### Suggested change

```
if (name === "amount" && type === "number") {
    let numericValue = parseFloat(value)
    if (isNaN(numericValue)) numericValue = 0
    [name]: numericValue
}
```

---

## 3. **onChange Handler Cleanliness**

### Observation

- The code uses a unified `handleChange` for all input types. However, textarea and number input have different requirements.
- The solution for type "number" relies on `parseFloat(value) || 0`, which will convert bad input (e.g., empty) to 0 and might confuse users.

### Recommendation

- Consider preserving empty input and only converting to number in validation or on submission. Also, distinguish input types for better clarity.

##### Suggested change

```
if (type === "checkbox") {
    // ...
} else if (type === "number") {
    [name]: value // keep as string
} else {
    [name]: value
}
```

_And, in validateForm:_

```
const amountValue = parseFloat(formData.amount)
if (isNaN(amountValue) || amountValue <= 0) {
    newErrors.amount = "Jumlah SPP harus lebih dari 0"
}
```

---

## 4. **UI: Accessibility on Form Inputs**

### Observation

- Radio inputs for levels use `className="sr-only"` for the input; they should include `id` and connect `<label htmlFor>` for a11y.

### Recommendation

- Give each `input` a unique `id`, and connect them with the `label`.

##### Suggested change

```
For each radio input:
<input id={`level-${level.value}`} ... />
<label htmlFor={`level-${level.value}`} ...> ... </label>
```

---

## 5. **Form Submission: Error Reporting**

### Observation

- On submit error, only `console.error` is called. No error UI is presented to the user.

### Recommendation

- Add user feedback for submit errors.

##### Suggested change

```
catch (error) {
    // Existing
    console.error("Form submission error:", error);
    // Add
    toast.error("Gagal menyimpan pengaturan SPP. Silakan coba lagi.");
}
```

---

## 6. **Form Submission: Prevent Multiple Submits**

### Observation

- With slow network, the form can be submitted multiple times as there's no internal loading state tied to submission.

### Recommendation

- Lock the form with an internal `loading` state, set at `handleSubmit` scope.

##### Suggested change

```
const [internalLoading, setInternalLoading] = useState(false);

// in handleSubmit
setInternalLoading(true)
try {
    await onSubmit(formData)
} finally {
    setInternalLoading(false)
}

// Button and input's disabled={isLoading || internalLoading}
```

_Alternatively, ensure downstream passes a stable isLoading prop._

---

## 7. **Type Annotation Consistency**

### Observation

- In several places `formData` is assumed to have a specific type, but since `amount` may be a string or number, consider typing for consistency.

### Recommendation

- Set `amount` type as `string|number` in formData if the UI handles both, or convert as appropriate.

---

## 8. **Component Memoization Optimization**

### Observation

- `getLevelInfo` is called multiple times in the render, and for the same value.

### Recommendation

- Memoize `getLevelInfo(formData.level)` with `useMemo`.

##### Suggested change

```
const selectedLevelInfo = useMemo(
    () => getLevelInfo(formData.level),
    [formData.level]
)

// use selectedLevelInfo in the render
```

---

## 9. **Magic Strings (Variants in Badge)**

### Observation

- The string "success" and "secondary" are used for the `Badge` variant. If these variants aren't defined, there may be an error.

### Recommendation

- Ensure variants are correctly defined, else default to an existing variant.

---

## 10. **Imports and Best Practices**

### Observation

- `Button` and `Input` are imported with inconsistent casing (`Button`, `Input`), but badge is imported as `{ Badge }`.

### Recommendation

- Use the same import style for all UI component library imports.

---

## 11. **Numeric Input Usability**

### Observation

- `<Input type="number">` is used, but value is always set from the state, so an empty field cannot be maintained; any invalid input results in `0`.

### Recommendation

- Store amount as "string" in form state, parse to number before submit/validation.

##### Suggested change

```
// When changing
[name]: value

// When validating
const numericAmount = parseFloat(formData.amount)
...
```

---

## 12. **Miscellaneous: Level Empty Option**

### Observation

- The 'Semua Level' radio does not display an icon to match the rest.

### Recommendation

- For consistency, consider adding a generic or empty icon for visual alignment.

# **Conclusion**

While the component is mostly sound and follows common React and UI conventions, attention should be paid to **form state management (especially with numbers and input conversion)**, **user feedback for errors**, and **a11y/visual consistency**. Applying the above recommendations will result in more robust, maintainable, and industry-standard code.
