## Detailed Findings

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Location:**

```jsx
<p className="font-medium text-gray-900">
  {formData.name || "Nama SPP"}
</p>
...
{formData.description && (
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-3 pt-3 border-t border-gray-200">
    {formData.description}
  </p>
)}
```

**Explanation:**

- The values of `formData.name` and `formData.description` are taken directly from user input and rendered into the DOM.
- While React escapes HTML by default and mitigates most XSS risks with plain text, if other places in the larger application use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or display this data elsewhere in a non-escaped context, XSS could occur.
- If these values ever get stored and displayed in non-React environments (email, PDFs, server-rendered templates), input sanitization may be required at both input and output points.

**Recommendation:**

- Validate and/or sanitize input both client and server-side.
- If rendering untrusted HTML in the future, always sanitize and avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Optionally, restrict allowed characters or enforce max length to minimize risk.

---

### 2. Unrestricted Input Lengths

**Location:**

- `name` and `description` fields.

**Explanation:**

- No client-side maximum length limit on text input for `name` or `description` fields.
- May allow excessively large payloads that could lead to DoS risks or buffer allocation abuse in downstream processes.

**Recommendation:**

- Implement `maxLength` attributes on all text and textarea fields (e.g., 128 chars for `name`, 1024 for `description`).
- Enforce these limits on the server as well.

---

### 3. Data Validation Bypass

**Location:**

- Client-side validation only present in `validateForm`.
- Actual data submission handled by the external `onSubmit` function.

**Explanation:**

- Relying only on client-side validation is insecure, as this can be bypassed with crafted requests.
- The code does not directly handle any remote submission (defers to parent). However, if server-side code reuses this validation logic, unexpected or invalid data could be accepted.

**Recommendation:**

- **Always** enforce input validation and sanitation server-side in addition to (not instead of) client-side validation.

---

### 4. External Component Supply-Chain Risk

**Location:**

- Use of `react-hot-toast`, `lucide-react`, and components from `"@/components/ui/..."`

**Explanation:**

- There is an implicit trust required of all third-party dependencies. If any become compromised or have supply-chain vulnerabilities (e.g., malicious code injected into dependencies), security of your app is at risk.

**Recommendation:**

- Monitor NPM advisories for third-party library vulnerabilities.
- Use lockfiles and pin versions where possible.
- Vet custom component code for similar issues when integrating.

---

### 5. CSRF

**Location:**

- Not handled in this component.

**Explanation:**

- CSRF mitigations are out-of-scope for this specific code, as submission is delegated to an external `onSubmit` prop, likely only relevant in the parent or API handler.

---

## Not Found / Not Applicable

- **Insecure Direct DOM Manipulation:**  
  No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or untrusted DOM mutation in this component.

- **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  
  No sensitive/session data is handled or exposed here.

---

## Recommendations (Action Items)

1. **Add `maxLength` to Input Fields**

   ```jsx
   <Input maxLength={128} ... />
   <textarea maxLength={1024} ... />
   ```

2. **Review Use/Display of User Inputs**
   - If displaying `description` and `name` elsewhere, always treat as untrusted.
   - Escape or strip dangerous input.
   - Consider third-party libraries for string sanitization (e.g., `dompurify` for HTML).

3. **Enforce Server-Side Validation**
   - Confirm that `onSubmit` (or the server/API endpoint it calls) validates all fields, including type, length, and business logic.

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Use tools like `npm audit` and dependabot.
   - Regularly update dependencies.

---

## Conclusion

**Severity:** _Low to Moderate_  
While the risk is mostly mitigated by React's default escaping, always double validate user data and protect all user input points from common web attacks, including XSS and abuse via uncontrolled input sizes. Always assume client-side code can be bypassed.
