# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## Report Scope

This report analyzes the provided `SantriForm` React component code and **focuses exclusively on security vulnerabilities** found within the code itself (client-side) and highlights patterns that may contribute to security risks, including those that may arise when this component interacts with backend APIs or when data is rendered onscreen.

---

## 1. **Lack of Client-side XSS Mitigations**

Although this is a React application (and JSX escapes by default), there are possible edge-cases:

- **Rendering Untrusted Data in `<option>` and `<Badge>`**  
  The `<option>` elements for `waliList` and `halaqahList` use `{wali.name}` and `{halaqah.name}` directly. If these values are not properly sanitized on the backend, and if React's default auto-escaping is somehow circumvented or a vulnerable version is used, this could be exploited for reflected XSS.
  > **Risk level:** _Low_ (React escapes by default), but **backend should sanitize** these fields.

---

## 2. **Potential Exposure of Sensitive Data**

- **No Sensitive Data Masking in Error Output or Logs**  
  Any errors encountered during form submission or data fetching are output via `console.error`. If the `formData` ever contains sensitive information in the future, it can be exposed in client console logs.
  > **Risk level:** _Low_. Current fields are not highly sensitive but **best practice is to avoid logging personal data**.

---

## 3. **Unvalidated/Unsafe API Fetch Calls**

- **Direct Use of API Endpoints (`/api/users?role=WALI` and `/api/halaqah`)**  
  The code fetches user and halaqah lists from presumed internal APIs. There is **no authentication, authorization, or anti-CSRF present** on these calls from the client side.
  > **Risk level:** _Medium_. This is a client-side form and relies on server controls, but the assumption that these endpoints are protected by authentication, rate limiting, and proper CORS/CSRF rules must be made explicit.
  - If these endpoints return sensitive data, it should be ensured that only authorized users can request them.

---

## 4. **Lack of CSRF/Clickjacking Protections (Assumed)**

- The form submits data via the `onSubmit` function, which is passed in as a prop (likely calling a backend API).  
  **There are no client-side anti-CSRF checks** (e.g., CSRF tokens). Relying only on HTTP APIs without CSRF protection could put the backend at risk, especially if cookies are used for authentication.
  > **Risk level:** _Medium-High_ (depending on deployment, session strategy & backend protections).

---

## 5. **Client-side Input Validation Only**

- Basic validation (e.g., regex for email and phone) is performed client-side.
- **No client-side sanitization of fields such as name, address, or other text fields.**
- **No HTML/script input filtering.**  
  If the backend does not strictly validate/sanitize these fields, malicious input can be sent to the backend and echoed elsewhere = _stored/reflected XSS_ risk.

  > **Risk level:** _High_ if backend does not validate/sanitize, _Low_ if it does.

---

## 6. **Denial-of-Service via Missing Request Throttling**

- The code does not limit the number or rate of requests. If not handled server-side, this endpoint can be spammed to disrupt service, especially `/api/users` and `/api/halaqah`.
  > **Risk level:** _Low_ if server protects, _Medium_ if not.

---

## 7. **Missing File Upload Handling (But Icon Suggests Possible Future Support)**

- There is an `ImageIcon` imported but not used, and a commented out `photo` field.
- Should file/image upload be implemented in the future, care must be taken to:
  - Enforce file type/size
  - Avoid arbitrary file upload
  - Avoid direct client-side rendering of uploaded images/URLs without sanitization

  > **Risk level:** _Informational_ (for future expansion).

---

## 8. **Error Message Exposure**

- User-facing errors are currently generic ("Gagal memuat data dropdown", etc), but internal errors are logged to the console. There is no display of backend error details to the user, which is good. Visual errors are sanitized.

  > **Risk level:** _Low_.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability Category       | Severity      | Notes/Recommendations                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| XSS via Option/Badge Content | Low           | Relies on backend sanitization; React escapes but double-check. |
| Sensitive Data in Logs       | Low           | Avoid logging personal data in `console.error`.                 |
| Unauthenticated API Calls    | Medium        | Ensure API endpoints are protected (auth, rate limiting).       |
| CSRF/Clickjacking            | Medium-High   | Ensure backend APIs are CSRF-protected.                         |
| No Server-side Validation    | High          | Backend **must** validate/sanitize all input again.             |
| Denial of Service Potential  | Low-Medium    | Server should rate limit.                                       |
| File Upload Safety (future)  | Informational | Review if/when file uploads are added.                          |
| Error Message Leakage        | Low           | No detailed server error leaked to user.                        |

## Recommendations

1. **Backend Input Validation**: All user-submitted data (especially name, address, etc.) must be validated and sanitized on server-side.
2. **API Security**: Require authentication and authorization for `/api/users` and `/api/halaqah`. Enforce role checks, rate-limiting, and proper CORS settings.
3. **CSRF Protection**: Use server-side CSRF tokens or other protections (especially for cookie-based authentication).
4. **Sensitive Data Handling**: Avoid logging full objects that could contain identifying or sensitive data.
5. **Check Option Rendering**: When rendering user-generated content in dropdowns or badges, double-check for proper escaping/sanitization.
6. **Plan Secure File Uploads**: If adding file upload, validate type/size and ensure files are not directly rendered/executable.

---

**In summary:**  
This React component is generally safe on the client if the server is properly secured.  
**All dangerous activity stems from trusting that server APIs are protected and that server-side validation/sanitization is in place.** Do not assume client-side validation is sufficient!
