# Security Vulnerability Report

**Component:** `SPPPaymentForm`  
**Language:** TypeScript / React  
**Scope:** Review for security vulnerabilities only  
**Date:** 2024-06

---

## Executive Summary

A review of the `SPPPaymentForm` React component was conducted, focusing solely on security vulnerabilities. The component handles user input for SPP payment forms, fetches account data, and submits payment details via an `onSubmit` handler.

Below are discovered (potential) security vulnerabilities, with detailed explanations and recommendations for mitigation.

---

## Findings

### 1. **Unescaped User Input Reflected in DOM (Potential XSS risk)**

#### Location(s):

- Several places in the JSX where text is output, such as:
  - `{sppRecord.santri.name}`
  - `{sppRecord.santri.nis}`
  - `{sppRecord.sppSetting.name}`
  - `{account.name}`, `{account.type}`
  - Output of `formData.notes`, `formData.receiptNumber`, etc., if added (though not directly shown here).

#### Problem:

- If any of these fields are not fully controlled and sanitized on the backend, or come from an untrusted source (e.g., user-generated), there is a risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Although React by default escapes output, risks increase if:
  - `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used in descendant components, or
  - Downstream components are not properly escaping content.

#### Recommendation:

- Be careful to ensure all interpolated values into the DOM are safe and trusted. Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless necessary and, if used, ensure proper escaping/sanitization of inputs.
- For data coming from user sources (notes, receiptNumber), sanitize and validate all data on both frontend and backend.
- Validate all output in custom UI components (`Input`, `Badge`, etc.) to ensure XSS is not possible through them.

### 2. **Fetch from API Without Authentication/Authorization**

#### Location(s):

- `const response = await fetch("/api/financial/accounts?isActive=true");`

#### Problem:

- No explicit authentication/authorization checks are shown for this data fetch. If the API endpoint or this fetch is accessible without adequate server-side checks, thereâ€™s a risk of unauthorized data exposure.

#### Recommendation:

- Ensure backend `/api/financial/accounts` route enforces both authentication and role-based authorization.
- Never trust client-side validation or role checks alone.
- Ideally, check whether the frontend route also requires authentication to access or render this component.

### 3. **No Handling for API Errors or Malicious API Responses**

#### Location(s):

- After fetching accounts, the code directly assumes a valid response format and sets `setAccounts(data.accounts || [])`.

#### Problem:

- Not validating the shape or type of the API response can lead to:
  - Denial of service (DoS) if an attacker (or misconfigured server) returns huge or malformed payloads
  - UI breakage
  - Potential pollution of downstream logic if unexpected data is set in state

#### Recommendation:

- Strictly validate API responses for both type and content.
- Where possible, constrain response data to only the required fields.
- Implement defensive programming and error handling.

### 4. **Uncontrolled User Input used in API/Submission**

#### Location(s):

- `onSubmit(formData)`, where `formData` contains user input.
- Particularly: `notes`, `receiptNumber`, `discount`, `fine`, etc.

#### Problem:

- If the submission handler or backend does not adequately validate, sanitize, or authorize the submitted data, attackers can inject malicious content.
- Amounts/discounts/fines are numbers, but form input can be manipulated (e.g., via browser dev tools).

#### Recommendation:

- Enforce all validation, constraints, and integrity checks on the backend. Client-side validation is helpful for user experience only and should not be trusted for security.
- For text input (notes, receiptNumber, etc.), sanitize or escape input to prevent injection attacks.

### 5. **No CSRF Protection Mentioned**

#### Location(s):

- `await fetch(...)` and `onSubmit(...)` handler

#### Problem:

- If the form submission or API endpoints use cookies/session-based tokens for authentication, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a risk.

#### Recommendation:

- Use CSRF tokens on all state-changing routes.
- If using JWT authorization (with header-based tokens), risk is lower but still assess whether CSRF tokens are warranted.

### 6. **Information Disclosure via Receipt Numbers**

#### Location(s):

- `generateReceiptNumber()`: Receipt numbers are generated client-side, in a predictable format: `SPP${year}${month}${random}` with a random 3-digit code.

#### Problem:

- Predictable receipt numbers can aid enumeration, replay, or impersonation attacks, depending on how these are used server-side.

#### Recommendation:

- Generate critical identifiers (like receipt numbers) on the server after performing necessary checks.
- If generating on the frontend, ensure the backend validates and/or re-generates secure, unique values.

### 7. **No Rate Limiting on API Calls**

#### Location(s):

- Any fetch or form submission can be spammed or automated.

#### Problem:

- Repeatedly calling the API (e.g., loading accounts or submitting the payment) with malicious or garbage data can cause denial of service or fill logs with bad data.

#### Recommendation:

- Implement rate limiting and abuse protection on backend routes.

## Risk Assessment

| Vulnerability                           | Risk Level | Mitigation Priority |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Unescaped user input, XSS               | Medium     | High                |
| API route lacks auth/authz              | High       | Critical            |
| Unvalidated API responses               | Low-Med    | Medium              |
| Uncontrolled user input in submission   | Medium     | High                |
| No CSRF protection                      | High       | High                |
| Predictable client-side receipt numbers | Low        | Medium              |
| No rate limiting                        | Medium     | Medium              |

## Recommendations

1. **Enforce authentication and role-based authorization** on all API routes accessed by this component.
2. **Sanitize and validate** all user inputs, both on frontend and backend, especially free-form text fields.
3. **Never trust client-side validation alone**. Always thoroughly validate and sanitize on the server.
4. **Avoid generating critical or unique identifiers (e.g., receipt numbers) on the client.** Instead, generate these on the server.
5. **Implement CSRF protections** if your session model is vulnerable.
6. **Validate and constrain shape/content of API responses** before use.
7. **Rate limit API endpoints** and monitor for abuse.
8. **Be vigilant for XSS:** If you later interpolate any unsanitized user content into the UI using custom logic or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, sanitize those values before rendering.

## Conclusion

This component does not demonstrate any direct exploitation vectors out-of-the-box, but multiple security best practices are not explicitly enforced. The bulk of issues stem from trusting client-side validation, the absence of backend security assurance mechanisms, or from poor handling of user-provided data. Following the recommendations above will mitigate most common vulnerabilities.
