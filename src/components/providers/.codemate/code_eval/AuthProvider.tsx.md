# Critical Review of the Provided Code

---

## General Observations

- The code adheres to modern React/TypeScript, using context, hooks, and NextAuth for session management.
- It combines actual authentication with mock logic for demo/fallback purposes.
- Most of the structure is sound, but several areas could be improved for industry-grade robustness, optimization, and error handling.

---

## 1. **Local Storage Access Outside UseEffect (Next.js SSR Trap)**

### Issue

Accessing `localStorage` in React code may result in errors during SSR or SSG, since `localStorage` isn't available on the server. For example, even in your `updateUser`, `logout`, and various logic branches, you call `localStorage` without checking `typeof window`.

#### Suggested Correction (Pseudocode)

```ts
// Wrap any localStorage access
if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  // ... localStorage code ...
}
```

---

## 2. **Unoptimized/Unsafe Local Storage Writes on Every Render**

### Issue

Frequent & unconditional writes to `localStorage`, especially in effects or on every auth change, can incur performance and consistency issues.

#### Suggested Correction (Pseudocode)

```ts
// Before each localStorage.setItem, ensure
if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  localStorage.setItem(...);
}
```

or if using useEffect to sync:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  if (user && typeof window !== "undefined") {
    localStorage.setItem("auth_user", JSON.stringify(user));
  }
}, [user]);
```

---

## 3. **Potentially Insecure/Unused Tokens**

### Issue

You generate and store a mock token string like `mock_token_${Date.now()}` but never validate or utilize it. This can be a security anti-pattern.

#### Suggested Correction

- **Remove token if not validated or used.**
- **If you must use, add logic for expiration and validation.**
- Consider using cookies for session info.

---

## 4. **Possible Stale Session/State Between Real and Mock Auth**

### Issue

If one user logs in via the mock mechanism and later you have a real NextAuth session, these could be inconsistent. The code blindly trusts either, which may result in stale or conflicting state.

#### Suggested Correction

```ts
// Always prefer NextAuth state when available.
// On logout, signOut should clear all state and localStorage.
```

---

## 5. **Hardcoded Role Fallback May Breach Least-Privilege Principles**

### Issue

In the translation from NextAuth session to `User` type, you fallback to role `"WALI"` (see: `role: session.user.role || "WALI"`).  
This could accidentally grant higher access.

#### Suggested Correction

```ts
role: "role" in session.user ? session.user.role : "SANTRI"; // or lowest role
```

---

## 6. **Missing Error Handling on JSON.parse**

### Issue

Parsing invalid localStorage could throw and break your effect logic.

#### Suggested Correction

```ts
try {
  const userData = JSON.parse(storedUser);
  setUser(userData);
} catch (e) {
  localStorage.removeItem("auth_user");
  localStorage.removeItem("auth_token");
  setUser(null);
}
```

---

## 7. **Return Value Typing/Behavior in Custom Hooks**

### Issue

Your custom hook `useAuth` throws an error if used outside a provider, which is good. However, not all consumers may expect that throw.  
Provide more graceful fallback or explicit error boundaries.

---

## 8. **Redirects in React Components without useRouter**

### Issue

Direct assignment to `window.location.href = ...` bypasses React/Next.js router, which break SPA navigation and history.

#### Suggested Correction (Pseudocode)

```ts
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
// ...
const router = useRouter();
// ...
router.push("/login");
```

---

## 9. **Possible Double Loading State**

### Issue

- `loading: loading || status === "loading"` may obscure which loading state you are in.
- Be explicit which phase (local vs. NextAuth) you are waiting for.

#### Suggested Correction

```ts
loading: loading || status === "loading" || typeof window === "undefined";
```

---

## 10. **Too Many Logger Statements in Production**

### Issue

Verbose `console.log` for loaded user/session data can leak information and pollute the console/logs.

#### Suggested Correction

```ts
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  console.log(...);
}
```

---

## 11. **Strong Typing for Session User Object**

### Issue

You expect `session.user` to have `id`, `role`, etc., but NextAuth may not always guarantee those are present on session objects.

#### Suggested Correction

```ts
const {
  id = "",
  name = "",
  email = "",
  role = "SANTRI",
  avatar,
} = session.user || {};
const userData: User = { id, name, email, role, avatar };
```

---

## 12. **Cleanup of State and Storage on Errors**

### Issue

If you fail login or encounter an error, make sure to consistently clear sensitive data.

#### Suggested Correction

```ts
// In catch/finally blocks of login/logout
if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  localStorage.removeItem("auth_user");
  localStorage.removeItem("auth_token");
}
```

---

## 13. **Optimize Default Handling in Display Name/Avatar**

### Issue

Both functions `getUserDisplayName` and `getUserAvatar` assume some user properties are always present.

#### Suggested Correction

```ts
export function getUserDisplayName(user: User): string {
  return user.name || (user.email ? user.email.split("@")[0] : "User");
}

export function getUserAvatar(user: User): string {
  return (
    user.avatar ||
    (user.name
      ? `https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=${encodeURIComponent(user.name)}&background=0d9488&color=fff`
      : "/default/avatar/path.jpg")
  );
}
```

## Example Corrections (as requested, not full code, but lines/blocks)

```ts
// 1. Guard localStorage use
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  localStorage.removeItem("auth_user");
}

// 2. Try/catch localStorage parses
try {
  const userData = JSON.parse(storedUser);
  setUser(userData);
} catch (e) {
  localStorage.removeItem("auth_user");
}

// 3. Next.js client navigation (replace window.location)
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
// ...
const router = useRouter();
router.push('/login');

// 4. Safe role fallback
role: typeof session.user?.role === "string" ? session.user.role : "SANTRI"

// 5. Logging guard
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  console.log(...)
}
```

# Final Note

The code is generally well-written for a demo or prototype, but the above changes are important for production-readiness, security, maintainability, and SSR/CSR safety in Next.js/React.
