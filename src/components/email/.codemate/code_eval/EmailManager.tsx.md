# Code Review Report

## Overall

The `EmailManager` component is generally clean, readable, and follows React best practices. However, there are several areas of concern regarding industry standards, error handling, performance, and minor semantic/logic issues. Please see specific comments and suggestions below.

---

## Code Review & Issues

### 1. Inefficient & Potentially Rate-Limited Email Sending

**Issue:**  
You send one HTTP request for each recipient in parallel (with `Promise.allSettled`). This can quickly overwhelm your email provider or run into rate limiting, especially with a long recipient list.

**Suggestion:**  
Implement batching (chunking) and add a `delay` between each batch, or create a backend route for _bulk_ sending in one API call.

**Sample Pseudocode:**

```js
// Pseudocode: Add batching logic
const batchSize = 10;
for (let i = 0; i < selectedRecipients.length; i += batchSize) {
  const batch = selectedRecipients.slice(i, i + batchSize);
  await Promise.all(batch.map((recipientId) => sendRequest(recipientId)));
  // Optionally: await delay(300); // Add a tiny delay between batches
}
```

### 2. Rendering `.env` Variables on the Client Side

**Issue:**  
`process.env` variables are never available to the browser at runtime unless you "bundle" them via e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC prefix. As is, these will always resolve as undefined on the client.

**Suggestion:**  
Fetch this data securely from your server (via API) and pass to the component as props or via a fetch in `useEffect()`.

**Sample Pseudocode:**

```js
// Pseudocode: Fetch email settings in useEffect
const [emailSettings, setEmailSettings] = useState({});
useEffect(() => {
  fetch("/api/email/settings")
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then(setEmailSettings);
}, []);
// Then use emailSettings.SMTP_HOST etc in your JSX.
```

---

### 3. Unimplemented Recipient Selection UI

**Issue:**  
Recipient selection is missing; UI only shows placeholder text.

**Suggestion:**  
Implement a MultiSelect UI or a list with checkboxes for users.

**Sample Pseudocode:**

```js
// Pseudocode: Render actual list of recipients with checkboxes
users.map((user) => (
  <div key={user.id}>
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={selectedRecipients.includes(user.id)}
      onChange={() => toggleRecipient(user.id)}
    />
    {user.email}
  </div>
));
```

---

### 4. Missing "users" Data Source

**Issue:**  
There is no data source (state or prop) called `users` for recipient selection.

**Suggestion:**  
Add state for `users`, fetch it (e.g., in `loadEmailData`), and update recipient selection code.

**Sample Pseudocode:**

```js
// Pseudocode: Add in state and fetching
const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
const loadEmailData = async () => {
  ...
  const usersRes = await fetch("/api/users");
  if (usersRes.ok) {
    setUsers(await usersRes.json());
  }
  ...
}
```

---

### 5. Unnecessary `.replace(/\n/g, "<br>")` on Every Textarea Submission

**Issue:**  
Replacing newline with `<br>` is presentation logic. You would do this when displaying emails, not submitting them to the backend.

**Suggestion:**  
Remove this transformation unless your backend requires literal HTML for emails.

**Sample Pseudocode:**

```js
// Pseudocode: Just send text as-is, let backend handle HTML formatting if needed
data: {
  subject: emailSubject,
  text: emailContent,
  // backend can generate HTML if necessary
}
```

---

### 6. Error Handling: Test Email Handler

**Issue:**  
Error messages from failed `fetch` assume response is JSON and contains `error` field. This can throw another error if the response is not JSON.

**Suggestion:**  
Add defensive error parsing.

**Sample Pseudocode:**

```js
let errorMsg = "Unknown error";
try {
  const error = await response.json();
  errorMsg = error.error || errorMsg;
} catch (e) {
  /* fallback: keep default message */
}
toast.error(`Gagal mengirim test email: ${errorMsg}`);
```

---

### 7. Performance - `loadEmailData()` on Resend

**Issue:**  
After sending emails, you call `loadEmailData()`, which fetches all logs, stats, and (possibly, after fix) users again. This makes the UX slow.

**Suggestion:**  
Update only the relevant parts of the state (e.g., prepend new log entries) or refetch just emails logs/statistics.

---

### 8. No Loading Skeleton/UI

**Issue:**  
No visual cue for user while `loading` is `true`. This may hurt UX.

**Suggestion:**  
Show Skeleton/Spinner or grey out main content when loading.

**Sample Pseudocode:**

```js
if (loading) return <Spinner />;
```

---

### 9. Hardcoded Strings (i18n)

**Issue:**  
Hardcoding many user-facing UI texts. While fine for MVP, for scalable industry standards this should use i18n/l10n.

---

### 10. Missed Error Edge Cases

**Issue:**  
Some API failures may be silent or report only the first error seen. Better error aggregation/reporting preferred.

**Suggestion:**  
Aggregate and display common errors, optionally allow retrying failed sends.
