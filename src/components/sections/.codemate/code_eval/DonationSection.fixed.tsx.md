# Critical Code Review Report

## Overall Observations

- Code is generally adhering to React and TypeScript standards.
- There are some unoptimized patterns, anti-patterns, and minor potential bugs.
- There are also places where code can be simplified or modernized for better maintainability, safety, and performance.

---

## 1. **State Updates Inside useMemo**

**Issue:**  
Inside the `selectedCategoryData = React.useMemo(...)`, you call `setTimeout(() => setSelectedCategory(..))`. Updating state inside render or memo causes React warnings and can lead to unpredictable behaviors.

**Fix:** Move that category state initialization to a separate `useEffect` (see suggestion below).

**Suggested Code (pseudo code):**

```pseudo
// Add this useEffect after the useEffect for fetching categories

useEffect(() => {
  if (donationCategories.length > 0 && !selectedCategory) {
    setSelectedCategory(donationCategories[0].id);
  }
}, [donationCategories, selectedCategory]);
```
````

And simplify the useMemo:

```pseudo
const selectedCategoryData = useMemo(() => {
  return donationCategories.find(cat => cat.id === selectedCategory);
}, [selectedCategory, donationCategories]);
```

---

## 2. **Parsing integer from potentially empty string**

**Issue:**  
`const finalAmount = selectedAmount || parseInt(customAmount) || 0;`

- If `customAmount` is an empty string, `parseInt('')` returns `NaN`, so you sometimes may get `0`, but it is clearer and safer to explicitly check for empty value.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
const customAmountValue = customAmount ? parseInt(customAmount, 10) : 0;
const finalAmount = selectedAmount !== null ? selectedAmount : customAmountValue;
```

---

## 3. **localStorage access on the server (Next.js “use client” is OK, but be explicit)**

**Comment:**  
Your code uses `"use client"` and is not in SSR context, so localStorage is safe, but always document or safeguard for future teammates.

---

## 4. **Uncontrolled use of Magic Strings for Payment Gateway**

**Issue:**  
The value `"MIDTRANS"` is a magic string; consider putting in a constant or `enum` at the top of file for maintainability.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
const PAYMENT_GATEWAY_MIDTRANS = "MIDTRANS";
// ...
gateway: PAYMENT_GATEWAY_MIDTRANS,
```

---

## 5. **API Error Handling Double Finally/Set Loading**

**Issue:**  
Redundant `setIsLoading(false)` in both catch and finally of `handleDonationSubmit`.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
// Remove setIsLoading(false) from catch, keep only in finally
```

---

## 6. **Missing Dependency in useEffect**

**Issue:**  
Your categories fetch useEffect depends on nothing (`[]`).  
But it also sets `setSelectedCategory` which could theoretically change elsewhere.  
This is OK as per your intention, but if you want to maximize correctness:

**Suggestion:**
Ensure you never have state updates for unmounted components or race conditions:

```pseudo
useEffect(() => {
  let isMounted = true;
  // ... fetch and set only if isMounted
  return () => { isMounted = false; };
}, []);
```

---

## 7. **Unoptimized "onChange" Inline in Form Inputs**

**Issue:**  
Each `onChange` is defined inline in render.  
For frequently rerendered lists/forms, consider wrapping change handlers, especially if Input is custom or memoized.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
const handleInputChange = (field) => (e) => handleDonorDataChange(field, e.target.value);

// ... usage:
<Input onChange={handleInputChange("email")} ... />
```

---

## 8. **Lack of Memoization for getIconComponent**

**Issue:**  
`getIconComponent` is defined every render. Consider memoizing if heavy.

**Optional, only if you're profiling:**

```pseudo
const getIconComponent = useCallback((iconName) => {
  // ...same function
}, []);
```

---

## 9. **Typo: Payment Method Selection**

Your UI allows a payment method selection but only sends `"MIDTRANS"` constant as gateway. If you expect to support more gateways or actual mapping, this is a maintainability problem.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
const gateways = {
  bank: "MIDTRANS",
  ewallet: "EWALLET_GATEWAY",
  qris: "QRIS_GATEWAY",
};
// ...
gateway: gateways[selectedPayment],
```

or, if only MIDTRANS is used, comment this explicitly:

```pseudo
// Only MIDTRANS is supported for all payment methods, at this time.
gateway: "MIDTRANS",
```

---

## 10. **Too Many Console Logs for Production**

**Issue:**  
There is excessive use of `console.log` and `console.error` which can clutter logs in production.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
// Remove or wrap logs in a conditional
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  console.log(...);
}
```

---

## 11. **Potential Issues with Array Index Key for List**

Not applicable here, as you're using ID as key.  
**Good.**

---

## 12. **Timeout-based Redirect is Fragile**

Consider redirecting after toast is confirmed, or use router's `push` in React whenever possible.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
// Import router:
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
const router = useRouter();
// Then:
setTimeout(() => {
  router.push(result.data.paymentUrl); // if internal; else use window.location.href for external
}, 1000);
```

---

## 13. **No Validation of Email/Phone Format**

Kinesthetic, but consider adding at least minimal format validation before submission.

**Suggested Code:**

```pseudo
if (!donorData.isAnonymous && !isValidEmail(donorData.email)) {
  addToast({type: "error", ...});
}
```

# **Conclusion**

There are no catastrophic errors, but several best-practice and optimization issues are present, mostly around state management, defensive programming, and maintainability.  
Correct the highlighted issues for more durable, readable, and production-ready code.
