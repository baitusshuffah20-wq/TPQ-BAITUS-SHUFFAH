# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## File Overview

The provided code is a React component (likely in a Next.js environment) that renders a website footer. It includes links, static content, and social media buttons.

This report focuses **only** on potential security vulnerabilities present in the code as written.

---

## Identified Security Issues

### 1. Social Media `<a>` Tags Use `href="#"`

**Description:**  
Social media icons in the `socialLinks` array use `href="#"`, making them dummy links in the UI. However, if any actual URLs (especially external sites) are inserted in the future, the current implementation will have vulnerabilities:

```jsx
<a
  key={social.name}
  href={social.href}
  className="..."
  aria-label={social.name}
>
  <Icon className="h-4 w-4" />
</a>
```

**Potential Vulnerability:**

- If replaced with actual external URLs, these links do **not** include `target="_blank"` or `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- This omission can lead to [reverse tabnabbing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing) if a malicious external site is linked.

**Implication:**  
Users who click external links that open in new tabs may be at risk (if `target="_blank"` is later added without `rel="noopener noreferrer"`).

**Recommendation:**  
Implement explicit logic:

```jsx
<a
  ...
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
```

Or, enforce all externally-destined links to have proper target and rel attributes.

### 2. Use of `mailto:` and `tel:` Not Explicit

**Description:**  
Contact information is displayed as plain text (not as clickable links):

```jsx
<span>0822-8978-2223</span>
<span>baitusshuffah@gmail.com</span>
```

**Potential Issue:**

- Not a security vulnerabilityâ€”just note that displaying these as mailto/tel links would not create risk in this context (unlike content injection).

---

### 3. Next.js `<Link>` Usage Appears Safe

**Description:**  
Navigation links (to internal routes) are rendered with:

```jsx
<Link href={link.href}>...</Link>
```

Where `link.href` values are hardcoded.

**Assessment:**

- No dynamic user-supplied content is used.
- No risk of open redirects, XSS, or similar issues in this code.

---

### 4. **No Input, No Output Encoding Risks**

- There is no user-supplied, unchecked content rendered.
- There are no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or equivalent constructs.
- No eval, no direct DOM access, etc.

---

### 5. **Icons from Third-party Library**

- No direct security risks as icons are statically imported.
- No risky SVG injection.

---

## Recommendations

- **Future Proof:** If you or future developers convert any of the social or external links to open in a new tab, always use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` with `target="_blank"`.
  - **Example:**
  ```jsx
  <a
    href="https://instagram.com/example"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    ...
  >
    ...
  </a>
  ```
- **Sanitize Any Dynamic URLs**: If you later accept dynamic URLs as props/state/user input (e.g., user-provided social links), always validate them.

---

## Conclusion

**No direct security vulnerabilities present in this static footer code as written.**  
**However, there is a risk of reverse tabnabbing if social links are later pointed to external URLs and use `target="_blank"` without `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.**

**Remain vigilant if future development introduces dynamic content or external linking.**
