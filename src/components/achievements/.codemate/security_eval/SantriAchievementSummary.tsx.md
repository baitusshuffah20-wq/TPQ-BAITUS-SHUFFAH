# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## File: SantriAchievementSummary.tsx

Below is a security-focused review of the provided React code. Only security vulnerabilities (potential and actual) are discussed.

---

## 1. Untrusted Input Rendering (XSS Attacks)

### Issue

- The component directly renders the following **props** into the JSX:
  - `santriName`
  - `santriNis`
  - `halaqahName`
  - `latestAchievement.badgeName`

#### Example

```jsx
<h3 className="font-bold text-lg">{santriName}</h3>
<span className="mr-3">{santriNis}</span>
<span>{halaqahName}</span>
<h5 className="font-medium">{latestAchievement.badgeName}</h5>
```

### Impact

Although React escapes string props by default, **any future change** that introduces dangerouslySetInnerHTML, or use of third-party UI primitives, could expose the application to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if these values are taken directly from a user-controlled source (such as a database or an API that accepts user input). You should ensure all input displayed is properly validated and/or sanitized elsewhere in your stack.

### Recommendation

- Verify on the backend (and/or before passing as props) that these values do not contain malicious content (e.g., scripts, HTML or SVG tags).
- Continue using React's default escaping by always rendering untrusted data as plain text; never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless needed, and always sanitize before use.

---

## 2. Lack of Prop Validation for Security

### Issue

- Component receives several props, including function handlers such as `onViewDetails`, from its parent.
- If `onViewDetails` or other function props are passed from untrusted sources, it could lead to unexpected consequences (e.g., code injection).

### Recommendation

- Use **TypeScript** to ensure type safety (already partially implemented).
- Ensure that parent components do not pass user-controlled functions as handlers. Any code-gen or dynamic handler should be properly vetted.

---

## 3. Information Disclosure

### Issue

- Sensitive information such as `santriNis` (likely a unique student identifier) and `santriName` is rendered to the UI.
- If the component is used in a context visible to unauthorized users, this could lead to privacy violations.

### Recommendation

- Restrict component or route access to authenticated users with correct permissions.
- Mask or redact sensitive identifiers unless strictly required.

---

## 4. ID-based Access / Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

### Issue

- The component receives `santriId` as a prop.
- If this component is part of a route like `/santri/:santriId`, and the backend does not check session authorization, a user could manipulate the URL to gain access to other users' achievement data.

### Recommendation

- Always validate that the authenticated user has access to the given `santriId` on the backend.
- Avoid sending more data than necessary to the frontend.

---

## 5. Third-party Component Risks

### Issue

- Use of custom components from paths like `@/components/ui/Card`, `@/components/ui/Button`, and `lucide-react` icons. If any of these perform string interpolation or render dangerouslySetInnerHTML (directly or via a packaging update), they may introduce vulnerabilities.

### Recommendation

- Periodically review third-party and internal UI components for security updates.
- Ensure that all external libraries are up to date.

---

## 6. External Links / Data Fetching

### Issue

- No external links or direct HTTP requests are present, so no related vulnerabilities here. However, if future modifications include them, ensure all data is sanitized.

## Summary Table

| Issue                           | Risk        | Mitigation                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| XSS via untrusted input         | Medium      | Ensure backend validation and React escaping.     |
| Prop validation/security        | Low         | Type safety & vetted parent handlers.             |
| Information disclosure          | Medium-High | Auth checks and restrict exposure.                |
| IDOR/insecure direct references | High        | Backend authorization checks per resource access. |
| Third-party components          | Low-Medium  | Audit and keep dependencies up-to-date.           |

---

## Conclusion

No **immediate, highly exploitable vulnerabilities** are evident given React's escaping and lack of direct HTML injection. However, care should be taken regarding **backend authorization, privacy, and input validation** to prevent escalation due to future changes or misuse.

---

**Action Items:**

- Verify all displayed data is properly sanitized and validated at the API/backend level.
- Implement and enforce robust authentication and authorization checks anywhere `santriId` or similar sensitive identifiers are involved.
- Audit third-party and internal UI component code for security best practices, especially regarding input rendering.
