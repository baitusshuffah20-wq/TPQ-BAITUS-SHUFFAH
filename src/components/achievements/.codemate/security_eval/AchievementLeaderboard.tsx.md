# Security Vulnerability Report for `AchievementLeaderboard` Component

## 1. **Image Injection (Untrusted `src`)**

```tsx
<img
  src={entry.photo}
  alt={entry.santriName}
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
/>
```

### **Risk**

- The component renders user-provided URLs (`entry.photo`) as image sources **without validation or sanitization**.
- If `entry.photo` is user-editable or fetched from untrusted sources, it could be used to exploit certain browser quirks or for phishing (e.g. data URLs, remote URLs, or social engineering using image content).
- If an attacker provides a `javascript:` or other dangerous protocol URI, it may result in XSS in older or improperly configured browsers (browsers commonly restrict `img` tags, but caution is still advised).

### **Recommendation**

- **Validate** that `entry.photo` is a legitimate URL and points to an expected image location.
- Consider serving user images through a trusted, sanitized image proxy.
- Strictly prevent inputs with suspicious protocols (e.g. `javascript:`, `data:`, or `blob:` unless these are legitimate).
- Sanitize or encode any untrusted user content.

## 2. **Unescaped User Data in Output (Potential XSS)**

Fields such as:

```tsx
alt={entry.santriName}
{entry.santriName}
{entry.santriNis}
{entry.halaqahName}
```

are rendered directly.

### **Risk**

- React escapes string content by default, which **strongly mitigates XSS** risks.
- However, if at any point `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar were used (not present in this code, but a possible future refactor risk), these fields would become attack vectors for XSS.

### **Recommendation**

- **Always avoid** the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with untrusted data.
- Continue to rely on React’s safe rendering of text content.

---

## 3. **Lack of Access Control or Authorization**

### **Observation**

- The component doesn't implement or enforce access control or authorization.
- If attacker can manipulate or view `entries` prop, private or sensitive information (including `santriNis` or `santriName`) could be leaked.

### **Recommendation**

- Ensure that only authorized actors can view or submit/edit leaderboard data.
- On the server side, filter sensitive info and do not trust client input.

---

## 4. **Click Handler (Untrusted Argument)**

```tsx
onClick={() => onViewSantri && onViewSantri(entry.santriId)}
```

### **Risk**

- The provided `santriId` is passed to a callback, likely controlled from a parent.
- If parent implementations use the `santriId` in unsafe navigation (e.g., URL construction without validation), it could present an open redirect or parameter injection risk.

### **Recommendation**

- Validate `santriId` format before utilizing in routes/URLs or server calls.
- Ensure the parent component sanitizes/validates values before use.

---

## 5. **Third-Party SVG Icon Rendering**

- Lucide icons are react components — unless modified by application code, these are safe, **unless icon names or SVG code are user-input**.
- **No vulnerabilities present as long as imported icons are not user-generated.**

# **Summary Table**

| Vulnerability      | Code Reference                  | Severity | Recommendation                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Image Injection    | `<img src={entry.photo} ... />` | Medium   | Validate/sanitize image `src` URLs from user input               |
| Potential XSS      | `{entry.santriName}` etc.       | Low      | Continue to avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with untrusted input |
| Access Control     | All `entries`-related code      | Context  | Ensure server-side access control on leaderboard data            |
| Callback Injection | `onViewSantri(entry.santriId)`  | Low/Med  | Validate/sanitize `santriId` in parent component/server          |

---

# **General Best Practices**

- **Do not trust client-side data**: All `entries` values should be sanitized and validated server-side.
- **Avoid dynamic or user-generated code/markup insertion**.
- **Audit parent code**: If the parent component using this leaderboard does any data interpolation/URL navigation, ensure safe handling there as well.
- **Consider security reviews on updates**: If data flows or image loading logic changes, reassess for security risks.

---

**No critical or direct vulnerabilities are present within this component if React's XSS safeguards are not circumvented; however, image field validation and careful callback use are highly advised.**
