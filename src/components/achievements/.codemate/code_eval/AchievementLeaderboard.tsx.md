# Code Review Report

This report critically examines your code for industry standards, potential errors, and optimization opportunities. Corrections and recommendations are provided as **pseudo code**, not as full code replacements.

---

## 1. **Sorting and Ranking Logic**

- **Issue:**  
  You sort by `totalPoints`, but use `entry.rank` for display (medals etc). If `rank` is not recalculated after sorting, it may not match the true leaderboard rank.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Recalculate `rank` based on sorted order, unless your input already assures alignment.

  **Suggested code:**

  ```pseudo
  const sortedEntries = [...entries]
    .sort((a, b) => b.totalPoints - a.totalPoints)
    .slice(0, limit)
    .map((entry, index) => ({
      ...entry,
      rank: index + 1, // Ensure displayed rank matches sort
    }));
  ```

---

## 2. **Unnecessary use of `getMedalColor`**

- **Issue:**  
  `getMedalColor` is defined but never used.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Remove unused functions to improve readability and reduce technical debt.

  **Suggested code:**

  ```pseudo
  // Remove getMedalColor function completely
  ```

---

## 3. **Key used in List**

- **Issue:**  
  You use `entry.santriId` as the key, which is generally correct. However, if there can be duplicate `santriId`s (even rare), use a composite key as backup.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Not strictly necessary; mention for consideration.

  **Suggested code (optional):**

  ```pseudo
  key={`${entry.santriId}-${entry.rank}`}
  ```

---

## 4. **Event Handler Best Practice**

- **Issue:**  
  Inline handler with conditional logic can create unnecessary re-renders.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Use `useCallback` hook for `onViewSantri`, or predefine a function.

  **Suggested code:**

  ```pseudo
  // If using in function component with hooks:
  const handleViewSantri = React.useCallback(
    (id) => { if (onViewSantri) onViewSantri(id); }, [onViewSantri]
  );

  // ...and then in JSX:
  onClick={() => handleViewSantri(entry.santriId)}
  ```

---

## 5. **Accessibility Improvements**

- **Issue:**  
  Divs with click events should have correct accessibility roles and tab index.

- **Recommendation:**
  - Add `role="button"` and `tabIndex={0}`.
  - Add `onKeyPress` handler for keyboard interaction.

  **Suggested code:**

  ```pseudo
  <div
    // ...
    role={onViewSantri ? "button" : undefined}
    tabIndex={onViewSantri ? 0 : undefined}
    onKeyPress={event => {
      if(event.key === "Enter" || event.key === " ") handleViewSantri(entry.santriId);
    }}
  >
  ```

---

## 6. **Image Alt Attributes**

- **Issue:**  
  For avatars, if the user name is missing, you may end up with `alt=undefined`.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Fallback for alt description.

  **Suggested code:**

  ```pseudo
  alt={entry.santriName || "Santri photo"}
  ```

---

## 7. **Performance: List Rendering**

- **Issue:**  
  For large lists, rendering many elements can be a problem. Although you slice at `limit`, mention using virtualization if ever scaled up.

- **Recommendation (Comment):**
  ```pseudo
  // TODO: Use virtualization (e.g. react-window) if expected entries become large (>50)
  ```

---

## 8. **Internationalization**

- **Issue:**  
  Static strings like "pts" and "badges" are hard-coded.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Move these to an i18n solution, or at least define as constants to support translations.

  **Suggested code:**

  ```pseudo
  const POINTS_LABEL = "pts";
  const BADGES_LABEL = "badges";
  // Use {POINTS_LABEL} and {BADGES_LABEL} in JSX
  ```

---

## 9. **Code Formatting**

- **Issue:**  
  Maintain component, variable and file names to be consistent and descriptive.

- **Recommendation:**  
  No corrections needed, just ensure consistency across repo.

---

## 10. **Prop Type Safety**

- **Issue:**  
  The types are strict but props like `photo` and callbacks may be undefined.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Defensive code as already in place, but maintain awareness.

  **No correction needed at this time.**

---

## 11. **Fragment for Map Rendering**

- **Issue:**  
  When mapping, if the parent div is dynamic (sometimes rendered, sometimes not), make sure to wrap map block with a Fragment if necessary.

- **No correction needed in your current use case.**
