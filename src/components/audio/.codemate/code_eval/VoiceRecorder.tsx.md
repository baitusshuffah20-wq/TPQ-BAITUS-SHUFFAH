# VoiceRecorder Code Review Report

### Summary:

The `VoiceRecorder` React component is overall well-structured, but there are several improvements necessary for **industry standards** in maintainability, performance, user experience, and bug prevention. Below are specific findings, with explanations and **proposed code corrections as pseudo code** for each item.

---

## 1. **Audio URL Revocation Bug**

- **Issue:** When you set a new audio URL (from `setAudioUrl`) without revoking the previous one, you risk memory leaks.
- **Recommendation:** Revoke the previous URL before updating with a new one.

**Correction:**

```pseudo
// Before updating audioUrl in setAudioUrl
if (audioUrl) {
  URL.revokeObjectURL(audioUrl)
}
setAudioUrl(newUrl)
```

---

## 2. **Reset Action Should Clean Up AudioRef**

- **Issue:** `resetRecording` should also pause and reset audioRef, not just the URLs/states, to prevent playing stale audio or keeping the audio element in an invalid state.
- **Recommendation:** Add logic within reset.

**Correction:**

```pseudo
if (audioRef.current) {
  audioRef.current.pause()
  audioRef.current.currentTime = 0
}
```

---

## 3. **Pausing/Resuming Should Not Start Multiple Timers**

- **Issue:** In `pauseRecording`, resuming sets a timer without clearing any existing timer, risking multiple intervals.
- **Recommendation:** Always clear the timer before setting a new one.

**Correction:**

```pseudo
if (timerRef.current) {
  clearInterval(timerRef.current)
}
timerRef.current = setInterval(...)
```

---

## 4. **Clean Unfinished Audio Source on Upload**

- **Issue:** Upload replaces audioUrl and audioBlob but does not revoke the previous blob's URL.
- **Recommendation:** Revoke audioUrl before replacing.

**Correction:**

```pseudo
if (audioUrl) {
  URL.revokeObjectURL(audioUrl)
}
setAudioUrl(newFileUrl)
```

---

## 5. **Remove Hidden Button for Delete vs. Reset**

- **Issue:** Both “Reset” and “Hapus” (delete) do almost the same thing but only “Reset” fully cleans up. The direct setAudioBlob(null) on delete is insufficient and leaves other states uncleared.
- **Recommendation:** Use `resetRecording()` for both.

**Correction:**

```pseudo
<Button onClick={resetRecording} ...>
  <Trash2 .../>
  Hapus
</Button>
```

---

## 6. **Error Handling: Always Clear Error Before New Action**

- **Issue:** If an error is set (like bad file upload) and user starts a new recording, the error should clear. Some actions do, but not all.

**Correction:**

```pseudo
// At start of startRecording, reset and clear error
setError("")
```

---

## 7. **Unoptimized Timer Logic**

- **Issue:** Timer management is spread and error-prone, risking missed cleanup and duplicate intervals.
- **Recommendation:** Refactor to always clear interval on record end, pause, and before new start.

**Correction:**

```pseudo
// Always do:
if (timerRef.current) clearInterval(timerRef.current);
// Before starting a new interval anywhere
timerRef.current = setInterval(...)
```

---

## 8. **MediaRecorder MIME Type Validity**

- **Issue:** `"audio/webm;codecs=opus"` is not supported on all browsers.
- **Recommendation:** Fallback MIME if unsupported (this is pseudo, in real code you should feature-detect).

**Correction:**

```pseudo
const mimeType = MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported("audio/webm;codecs=opus")
  ? "audio/webm;codecs=opus"
  : "";
const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream, { mimeType });
```

---

## 9. **Arbitrary File Assignment for audioBlob**

- **Issue:** `setAudioBlob(file)` in handleFileUpload: File is not always a Blob (for type safety, you may want to enforce this).
- **Recommendation:** Do a type guard or explicitly cast if you must support both.

**Correction:** _(or at least annotate)_

```pseudo
setAudioBlob(file as Blob)
```

---

## 10. **Permissions: Don’t Ask Permission Every Time**

- **Issue:** On every start, you request permission, even if it was previously granted.
- **Recommendation:** Cache permission and skip re-request after success.

**Correction (pseudo):**

```pseudo
if (hasPermission === true && streamRef.current) {
  useExistingStream
} else {
  requestMicrophonePermission
}
```

---

## 11. **State Updates on Unmounted Components**

- **Issue:** In timers, after recording is stopped, state updates may occur on unmounted components, risking warnings.
- **Recommendation:** In cleanup useEffect, use a ref isMounted pattern.

**Correction:**

```pseudo
const isMounted = useRef(true)
useEffect(() => {
  return () => { isMounted.current = false }
}, [])
// Before setState in timers:
if (!isMounted.current) return
```

---

## 12. **General Refactoring & Accessibility**

- **Recommendation:** Add `aria-label`s to buttons and controls for accessibility.

**Correction Example:**

```pseudo
<Button aria-label="Play or Pause Audio" ...>
```
