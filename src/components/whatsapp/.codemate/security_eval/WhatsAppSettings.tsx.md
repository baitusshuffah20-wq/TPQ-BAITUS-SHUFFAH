# Security Vulnerability Report

This report analyzes the provided React TypeScript code for **security vulnerabilities only**. The analysis focuses on potential weaknesses in code logic and data handling that may present risks such as information disclosure, injection, credential exposure, and bad security practices.

---

## 1. Exposure of Secrets in Front-end Code

### Issue

```js
Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CRON_SECRET || "demo-secret"}`;
```

- The code uses `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CRON_SECRET` to construct an Authorization header in a client-side file (`"use client";` at the top).
- Any environment variable prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` in Next.js is exposed to the browser and accessible to the client.
- If `NEXT_PUBLIC_CRON_SECRET` is used for authenticating sensitive API endpoints, it is not truly secret. Anyone with access to the front-end can view this value and use it to make unauthorized requests.

#### Impact

- An attacker can retrieve the value from the client bundle or console and simulate privileged requests, such as manually running crons or accessing sensitive API endpoints.

#### Recommendations

- Do **not** use sensitive secrets with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.
- Authenticate sensitive API endpoints using HTTP-only cookies or server-side validation inaccessible to the client.
- Use tokens/headers on the server side and not in the client bundle.

---

## 2. Demo Secret Fallback

```js
Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CRON_SECRET || "demo-secret"}`;
```

- The code falls back to "demo-secret" if no environment variable is set.
- Hardcoded dummy secrets could accidentally be used in production or staging environments.

#### Impact

- If the environment variable is misconfigured or missing, the system uses "demo-secret". Anyone with knowledge of this fallback could manipulate the system.

#### Recommendations

- Remove hardcoded secrets or ensure that the application fails securely when a required secret is missing.

---

## 3. Use of Unvalidated User Input

```js
<Input
  value={testPhone}
  onChange={(e) => setTestPhone(e.target.value)}
  placeholder="628123456789"
  className="mt-1"
/>
...
const testWhatsAppConnection = async () => {
  ...
  body: JSON.stringify({
    phone: testPhone,
    message: "Test connection dari WhatsApp Settings",
  }),
...
```

- The user's phone input (`testPhone`) is sent directly to the API without validation or sanitization.
- There is no validation to ensure that the value is numeric or in the right format.

#### Impact

- Potential abuse or input manipulation, especially if the backend does not validate/sanitize this input. Can lead to unwanted WhatsApp spam or even be exploited for injection attacks (if backend is insecure).

#### Recommendations

- Add robust client-side and backend validation for `testPhone`.
- Restrict input to valid, numeric, properly formatted phone numbers.

---

## 4. Overexposure of Environment Variables

```js
â€¢ Webhook URL should be set to: {process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/whatsapp/webhook
```

- `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is displayed in the UI for configuration.
- Not a direct vulnerability if the var is intended for public use, but double-check that no secret or sensitive data is exposed in configuration notes or UI.

---

## 5. No CSRF Protection for Sensitive Requests

- The code makes POST requests that trigger sensitive backend actions (e.g., `runManualCron`, `testWhatsAppConnection`) using fetch.
- There is **no evidence of CSRF protection** (cross-site request forgery), since the frontend code simply sends JSON; this relies on the backend to perform origin checks or token validation.

#### Impact

- Vulnerable to CSRF if the backend is not protected (if running in a browser context and the API does not verify properly).

#### Recommendations

- Ensure all sensitive endpoints implement CSRF protection (such as requiring a CSRF token or validating CORS/origin).

---

## 6. No Protection from Replay Attacks

- The use of a static or predictable secret (as in `demo-secret` or from an env variable) for privileged actions is susceptible to replay attacks. If an attacker gains access to the secret, they can replay requests indefinitely.

#### Impact

- Privileged actions can be triggered repeatedly by unauthorized users.

#### Recommendations

- Use short-lived, user-bound, or request-bound secrets/tokens for sensitive endpoints.
- Implement logging and rate limiting for privileged endpoints.

---

## 7. No Rate Limiting or Abuse Controls

- All action buttons (`Run Now`, `Send Test Message`) can be triggered repeatedly without rate limiting or abuse protection.

#### Impact

- Attacker or malicious user can spam API endpoints, leading to DoS conditions or excessive system messaging.

#### Recommendations

- Implement rate limiting on the backend for all such endpoints.
- Consider disabling the buttons temporarily after an action, or showing a cooldown timer.

---

## 8. Insufficient Error Handling for Sensitive Data

- Error messages from the backend are shown in toasts (`toast.error`). If backend error messages include sensitive internal info, these could be exposed to users.

#### Recommendations

- Backend should return only user-friendly, generic error messages.
- Devs should avoid passing raw error details to the frontend.

## **Key Remediations**

- **Move all secrets to the backend.** Never expose privileged credentials to the client.
- **Apply strong validation** on all user/submitted input, both on the client and, critically, the server.
- **Add anti-CSRF measures** and ensure authentication/authorization occur server-side.
- **Implement backend rate limiting** on all endpoints that can trigger external effects (notifications, messages, cron jobs).

---

**Note:** Some risks depend on complementary backend code, which is not provided here. Always ensure backend endpoints are never trust data or credentials from the client, and perform strict authorization checks for any privileged operation.
