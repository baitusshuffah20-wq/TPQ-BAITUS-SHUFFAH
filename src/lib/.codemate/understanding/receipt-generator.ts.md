### 2. **Receipt HTML Generation: `generateReceiptHTML` Function**

#### **Purpose:**

Generates a styled, printable HTML receipt using the data provided via the `ReceiptData` object.

#### **Workflow:**

- Formats currency values and dates appropriated for Indonesian locale ("id-ID").
- Embeds the student, payment, and SPP details in a visually styled HTML template.
- Dynamically shows or hides discount and fine rows depending on their values.
- Optionally displays a notes section if notes are present.
- Adds space for signatures and a receipt footer with auto-generated print date.
- Includes print-optimized CSS styling and an auto-print script.

### 3. **Receipt Number Generation: `generateReceiptNumber` Function**

#### **Purpose:**

## Not Covered

- No external dependencies except browser's JavaScript/TypeScript and standard browser APIs.
- No backend logic or database connectivity is presentâ€”this component only formats and renders receipt information provided to it.

**Summary:**  
This codebase offers a robust and flexible solution to automatically generate and print professional, locale-aware payment receipts for educational institutions in Indonesia. It focuses on data-driven, customizable, and visually structured output.
