# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Analyzed

```typescript
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

export interface AuthUser {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: "ADMIN" | "MUSYRIF" | "WALI" | "SANTRI";
}

export async function getAuthUser(
  request: NextRequest,
): Promise<AuthUser | null> {
  try {
    // Get auth token from cookies or headers
    const authToken =
      request.cookies.get("auth_token")?.value ||
      request.headers.get("Authorization")?.replace("Bearer ", "");

    if (!authToken) {
      return null;
    }

    // In a real app, you would validate the token here
    // For this demo, we'll check if it starts with "mock_token_"
    if (!authToken.startsWith("mock_token_")) {
      return null;
    }

    // Get user data from cookies or local storage
    // In a real app, you would decode the token or fetch user data from the database
    const userCookie = request.cookies.get("auth_user")?.value;

    if (!userCookie) {
      return null;
    }

    try {
      const userData = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(userCookie));
      return userData as AuthUser;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error parsing user data:", error);
      return null;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error getting auth user:", error);
    return null;
  }
}

export function isAdmin(user: AuthUser | null): boolean {
  return user?.role === "ADMIN";
}

## Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Insecure Handling of Authentication Token**

- **Description**: The code only checks if the `authToken` starts with the string `"mock_token_"`. This trivial check provides no real security and can be easily bypassed by an attacker supplying such a token.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to user accounts and privilege escalation.
- **Recommendation**: Use standard JWT or other cryptographically signed tokens, verifying their integrity and authenticity using a secret or public/private keys.

---

### 2. **Storing/Consuming Sensitive User Data from Client-Controlled Cookies**

- **Description**: The user object is fetched from a cookie (`auth_user`) and deserialized using `JSON.parse` on the value after decoding. Thereâ€™s no integrity or authenticity check for this structure.
- **Impact**: An attacker can forge or tamper with the `auth_user` cookie to impersonate any user by simply setting the cookie value in their browser, enabling privilege escalation or unauthorized access.
- **Recommendation**: Never trust sensitive data from client-side cookies. Always fetch user details from a trusted backend or include user info only in server-signed tokens (e.g., JWT), and always verify signatures.

---

### 3. **Potential Information Leak on Deserialization**

- **Description**: Errors in parsing user data are logged to the console, which, in production, may lead to inadvertent information disclosure if logs are exposed.
- **Impact**: Leaked error information may help attackers craft malicious payloads.
- **Recommendation**: Avoid logging sensitive or user-supplied data; sanitize error messages in logs.

---

### 4. **No Input Validation or Sanitization**

- **Description**: The content of user-provided cookies is used directly with no validation or sanitization before parsing.
- **Impact**: Malformed data could destabilize the service or enable denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via resource exhaustion.
- **Recommendation**: Although not a direct security exploit, always validate and sanitize input, and employ try-catch blocks for all user-facing parsing.

---

### 5. **Failure to Implement Secure Session Management**

- **Description**: There is no session expiration, invalidation, or robust token management, increasing the risk of replay attacks or session fixation.
- **Impact**: Stale or compromised sessions could be used maliciously.
- **Recommendation**: Implement secure session tokens, manage their lifetime, and regularly invalidate stale sessions.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                    | Severity | Recommendation                             |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Weak token inspection            | High     | Use signed tokens, always verify signature |
| Trusting user-modifiable cookies | High     | Never trust client data, fetch from server |
| Logging user-supplied errors     | Medium   | Sanitize logs, avoid user data in logs     |
| No input validation/sanitization | Medium   | Validate and sanitize all inputs           |
| No session management            | High     | Implement expirations and revocations      |

## Final Notes

- **Never trust client-side input or data** for authentication or authorization logic.
- **Always use secure, signed tokens** and fetch sensitive user details from backend services.
- **Do not log sensitive user information** that can be leveraged in an attack.
- **Implement secure cookie settings** (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).

**Addressing these vulnerabilities is critical to prevent unauthorized access, escalation of privileges, and leakage of sensitive information.**
