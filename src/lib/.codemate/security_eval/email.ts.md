# Security Vulnerabilities Report

Below is a security analysis of the provided code. This report focuses **only** on security vulnerabilities or areas where the code could introduce security risks, with descriptions and recommendations.

---

## 1. **Unvalidated Dynamic Content in Email Templates**

### Description

Many of the email templates inject unescaped, user-provided data directly into HTML using template literals (e.g., `${data.userName}` in HTML templates). If the `data` object comes from user input or untrusted sources, this opens the possibility for **HTML/JS Injection (Stored or Reflected XSS)**. If an attacker provides content with HTML or script tags, the generated emails could contain active content.

### Examples

```typescript
<p>Selamat datang <strong>${data.userName}</strong>!</p>
...
<a href="${data.loginUrl}" class="button">Masuk ke Sistem</a>
...
${data.notes}
```

### Risks

- **Phishing:** Attackers may trick recipients into clicking malicious links or submitting sensitive information.
- **Session/credential theft:** XSS in some email clients/webmail can execute JavaScript (some render HTML as trusted).
- **Brand/reputation damage:** Sending malicious or compromised emails to users.

### Recommendation

- **Sanitize all user-generated content** before inserting it into email templates, especially fields such as `userName`, `notes`, `description`, `content`, and URLs.
- Use a HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify for Node.js) to clean imported content before embedding.
- Never trust or inject raw user HTML.

---

## 2. **Lack of URL Validation**

### Description

Links in emails such as `${data.loginUrl}` or `${data.ctaUrl}` are inserted without validation or sanitization.

### Risks

Attackers might inject `javascript:` URLs or malicious domains, leading to phishing or code execution.

### Recommendation

- **Whitelist** allowed domains for URLs being inserted into templates.
- Reject or sanitize any URLs not conforming to `https?` protocols and your app's trusted domain.

---

## 3. **SMTP Credentials in Environment Variables with Insecure Defaults**

### Description

The SMTP config uses fallback defaults if environment variables aren't provided:

```typescript
host: process.env.SMTP_HOST || "smtp.gmail.com",
port: parseInt(process.env.SMTP_PORT || "587"),
secure: process.env.SMTP_SECURE === "true",
auth: {
  user: process.env.SMTP_USER || "",
  pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS || "",
},
```

- If `process.env.SMTP_USER` or `SMTP_PASS` aren't set, **empty strings are used**.
- `secure` can default to `false`.

### Risks

- Application may attempt authentication with empty credentials, sending sensitive email data in cleartext, or exposing information (such as connection attempts) to 3rd parties.
- Use of non-secure connections (`secure: false`) exposes credentials and emails to interception.

### Recommendation

- **Fail fast:** Throw an error if any critical SMTP configuration is missing, do not fallback to insecure/defaults.
- **Enforce secure connections** (`secure: true`) unless development is explicitly intended, and check for correct port/SSL usage.
- Consider a pre-flight check that prevents the service from starting with missing SMTP credentials.

---

## 4. **No Attachment Validation/Sanitization**

### Description

The `SendEmailOptions` interface allows arbitrary file attachments via either a Buffer or file path:

```typescript
attachments?: EmailAttachment[];
// ...
interface EmailAttachment {
  filename: string;
  content?: Buffer;
  path?: string;
  contentType?: string;
}
```

### Risks

- If the source of `attachments` is user-facing or externally controlled, attackers might attach undesirable or malicious files.
- The service currently does not appear to restrict file type, size, or sanitize file names.

### Recommendation

- **Restrict file types** (extensions and content types) and **limit file size** on all attachments.
- **Sanitize file names** (allow only alphanumerics, limit length, remove path traversals).
- If the source is not fully controlled by the developer, further validate the file's content.

---

## 5. **Error Logging May Leak Sensitive Information**

### Description

In multiple try/catch blocks (e.g., in `sendEmail`, `logEmail`), the code uses `console.error(error)`, which may log sensitive error details, including possibly SMTP credentials, rejected recipients, or unescaped/invalid inputs.

### Risks

- Sensitive information (credentials, personal data, error stack traces) could be exposed in logs, especially in production environments.
- Attackers who gain access to logs may retrieve this information.

### Recommendation

- Ensure error logging is sanitized before outputting to production logs.
- Avoid logging full exceptions unless to a secure, access-controlled log aggregator.
- Never log credential configurations.

---

## 6. **Potential for Mass/Spam Email Abuse**

### Description

The code exposes a method `sendNewsletter` that allows sending mass emails to an array of recipients. There is no rate limiting, anti-abuse measures, or restrictions.

### Risks

- Unrestricted sending may result in the application being used for spam, which could get your server or domain blacklisted.
- Large lists can cause denial-of-service (DoS) or performance issues.

### Recommendation

- Implement **rate limiting**, recipient caps, and allow only authenticated/authorized users to initiate mass emails.
- **Log** and **monitor** bulk sending operations.

---

## 7. **No Input Validation on Data Sent to Database**

### Description

All email log data is sent directly to the database without validation or sanitization:

```typescript
await prisma.emailLog.create({ data: { ... } });
```

### Risks

- Potential for injection attacks if ORM is misconfigured or if data contains malicious payloads (less likely with Prisma, but possible with future schema changes).
- Pollution of database with bad or malicious data.

### Recommendation

- Sanitize and validate all values sent to the database.
- Consider escaping, length limits, and content checks for log fields (especially `subject`, `messageId`, `error`, `recipient`, `template`).

---

## 8. **No Configuration Validation for Critical Operations**

### Description

The system checks if the service is configured with:

```typescript
isConfigured(): boolean {
  return !!(process.env.SMTP_HOST && process.env.SMTP_USER && process.env.SMTP_PASS);
}
```

However, the service can still be instantiated and used if not configured, possibly resulting in attempts to send mail without proper SMTP details.

### Risks

- May generate unintended behavior, error spam, or information leakage.

### Recommendation

- Enforce a strict configuration requirement upon service instantiation.
- Throw errors if critical SMTP configuration is missing.

# **Final Recommendations**

- **Review all user-facing inputs and outputs** for proper encoding, sanitization, and validation.
- **Fail securely**: Ensure the service refuses to operate or send emails if critical configuration is missing.
- **Monitor and audit** email sending, especially for mass operations.
- **Always prefer secure (SSL/TLS) connections** for email delivery.
- **Document** security practices for operators and developers using/modifying this code.

**Note:** If you use this code with actual (possibly untrusted) users or attach files from user uploads, addressing the above issues is critical to avoid data breach and legal/regulatory problems.
