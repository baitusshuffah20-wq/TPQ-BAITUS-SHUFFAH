# Security Vulnerability Report for `MidtransService` Code

## Overview

This report analyzes the security posture of the provided `MidtransService` TypeScript class. The focus is on identifying implementation patterns and coding practices that may pose security risks, particularly those affecting confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

---

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Hardcoded Credentials / Use of Static Configuration Object**

- **Description:**  
  The service fetches sensitive data—`serverKey` and `clientKey`—directly from `MIDTRANS_CONFIG` (presumably a static config or a file). Hardcoded or file-based credentials can easily be leaked in code repositories or inadvertently logged.
- **Code Example:**
  ```typescript
  this.serverKey = MIDTRANS_CONFIG.serverKey;
  this.clientKey = MIDTRANS_CONFIG.clientKey;
  ```
- **Risk:**  
  If `midtrans-config` is not securely managed, server keys can be leaked, allowing attackers to initiate fraudulent transactions or access sensitive information.
- **Mitigation:**  
  Use secured secrets vaults or environment variables. Do not commit keys to source code.

---

### 2. **Use of Node.js `Buffer` for Base64 Encoding**

- **Description:**  
  The Authorization header encodes the serverKey using `Buffer.from(...).toString("base64")`, which is standard, **however**:
  - There is no validation or sanitation for the encoded output.
  - If `serverKey` is mishandled or improperly scoped, it may be logged or exposed unintentionally.
- **Code Example:**
  ```typescript
  Authorization: `Basic ${Buffer.from(this.serverKey + ":").toString("base64")}`,
  ```
- **Risk:**  
  Buffer misuse and unvalidated keys may lead to key leakage or security issues if the code is adapted in a browser context.
- **Mitigation:**  
  Ensure that serverKey is kept secret and never exposed to client-side JavaScript. Additional runtime checks or environment scoping restrictions are advisable.

---

### 3. **Potential SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) Risk in Endpoint Construction**

- **Description:**  
  The code dynamically constructs API URLs by concatenating user-provided input (such as `orderId`) to the base API URL, e.g.,
  ```typescript
  `${this.apiUrl}/v2/${orderId}/status`;
  ```

  - If `orderId` is not strictly validated, this may allow path traversal or SSRF attacks.
- **Code Example:**
  ```typescript
  fetch(`${this.apiUrl}/v2/${orderId}/status`, ...)
  ```
- **Risk:**  
  Attacker-controlled `orderId` could alter the request path and target unintended endpoints if server-side validation is not sufficient.
- **Mitigation:**  
  Strictly validate or sanitize `orderId` to allow only expected formats (e.g., UUIDs or whitelisted patterns).

---

### 4. **Use of `any` Type in `validateNotification`**

- **Description:**  
  The `validateNotification` method accepts an untyped `any` object and reads several properties without validation.
- **Code Example:**
  ```typescript
  public validateNotification(notification: any): boolean {
      // ...
      const signatureKey = notification.signature_key;
      // ...
  }
  ```
- **Risk:**  
  Maliciously crafted notifications could trigger unexpected behavior or exceptions, or may facilitate signature bypass attempts if non-standard shapes are passed.
- **Mitigation:**  
  Validate the shape and data types of the notification object before using its properties. Use strong TypeScript interfaces to enforce structure. Do not catch all errors silently.

---

### 5. **Use of `require("crypto")` in Function Scope**

- **Description:**  
  The code calls `require("crypto")` inside the `validateNotification` method.
- **Risk:**  
  Dynamic requires may bypass static analysis and open possibilities of dependency confusion or code injection if paths are manipulated (unlikely here, but not best practice).
- **Mitigation:**  
  Use static imports at the top of the file for built-in modules like `crypto`.

---

### 6. **Improper Error Handling / Potential Information Disclosure**

- **Description:**  
  Errors are logged to the console and re-thrown; the error messages may originate from external sources (axios/REST responses, etc.), which could leak sensitive internal details to logs, and possibly responses.
- **Code Example:**
  ```typescript
  console.error("Error creating transaction:", error);
  throw error;
  ```
- **Risk:**  
  Attacker-supplied error messages (possibly passed through REST API error responses) could trigger log injection or information leakage in logs.
- **Mitigation:**  
  Sanitize error messages before logging and never log sensitive payloads or keys. Consider using a secure, centralized logging system with log redaction.

---

### 7. **Lack of Input Length and Character Restrictions**

- **Description:**  
  While the code validates some fields (emails, phone numbers), there are no specific checks around input lengths or allowable characters for critical identifiers (e.g., `order_id`, customer names, etc.).
- **Risk:**  
  An attacker may exploit this by passing exceedingly large or specially crafted strings to cause DoS or to probe for injection vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation:**  
  Add explicit length and character checks on all externally-derived inputs.

---

### 8. **Order ID Generation Predictability**

- **Description:**  
  The `generateOrderId` method creates order IDs using current time and a not-cryptographically-strong random string.
- **Code Example:**
  ```typescript
  const random = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8).toUpperCase();
  ```
- **Risk:**  
  Predictable order IDs make it easier for attackers to guess valid identifiers and perform enumeration, replay, or race-condition attacks.
- **Mitigation:**  
  Use cryptographically secure random generators (e.g., `crypto.randomBytes`) for the random part.

## Recommendations

1. **Secure Secrets**: Switch to properly managed environment secrets and never expose `serverKey` or `clientKey` to the frontend or in logs.
2. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user-facing inputs, not just for presence but also for max length and expected structure.
3. **Safer Logging**: Never log secrets or untrusted error messages; sanitize or redact logs before output.
4. **Stricter Typing**: Replace all `any` types with strict interfaces, especially on objects from untrusted external sources.
5. **Order ID Security**: Replace `Math.random()` with Node's `crypto.randomBytes` or similar CSPRNG methods.
6. **Static Imports**: Move all require/import statements to the top level to avoid dynamic resolution issues.
7. **Signature Verification Hardening**: In `validateNotification`, ensure all required properties exist, are strings, and have reasonable lengths and character sets.
8. **API Endpoint Safety**: Sanitize all path variables used in constructing endpoint URLs.

## Conclusion

While the core business logic is sound, the code can be significantly strengthened by applying secure coding practices as outlined above, especially in handling credentials, user inputs, and sensitive operations like transaction status or notifications.
