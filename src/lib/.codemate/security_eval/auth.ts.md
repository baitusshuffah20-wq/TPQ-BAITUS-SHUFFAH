# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

This report reviews the provided NextAuth authentication code for security vulnerabilities. The code uses the `credentials` provider with hardcoded/mock user data intended for testing and includes logic to verify passwords via bcrypt or a hardcoded string. The focus is only on **security issues** present in this code, not on performance or best practices otherwise.

---

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Use of Hardcoded Password in Authentication Logic

**Description:**

The following line accepts `"password"` **as a master password** for all users:

```ts
const isPasswordValid =
  credentials.password === "password" ||
  (await bcrypt.compare(credentials.password, user.password));
```

- Any user can authenticate using `password` as their password, irrespective of their actual password hash.

**Risk:**

- **Critical:** This creates a severe authentication bypass, allowing anyone to log in as any user if they know or guess this backdoor.

**Recommendation:**

- **Never** include hardcoded passwords for authentication, even in test or development code intended for reuse.

---

### 2. Storage of Password Hashes in Source Code

**Description:**

Mock users are defined with hashed passwords in the source file:

```ts
password: "$2a$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi", // password
```

**Risk:**

- **High (in production code):** Storing sensitive information such as password hashes in the codebase risks leakage if source code access is compromised. If this model is accidentally deployed to production or if the code is made public, it could expose valid password hashes.

**Recommendation:**

- Never store credentials or password hashes in source code. For testing, prefer environment variables, fixtures, or a dedicated test database.

---

### 3. Insecure/Improper Error Messaging (Potential Information Leakage)

**Description:**

The `authorize` function returns `null` for both incorrect username and incorrect password. While this is generally correct for production, in development, **overly verbose errors can reveal valid email addresses exist in the system** (not shown here, but ensure the login form or API does not distinguish between invalid email or password responses).

**Risk:**

- **Medium:** If extended to real users, this could allow attackers to enumerate valid users.

**Recommendation:**

- Always use **generic error messages** on authentication failures.

---

### 4. Absence of Rate Limiting on Authentication Attempts

**Description:**

No rate limiting or authentication throttling mechanism is evident.

**Risk:**

- **Medium:** Without throttling, attackers can brute-force passwords (especially dangerous with the master password issue above).

**Recommendation:**

- Implement rate limiting or introduce delay for repeated failed login attempts.

---

### 5. Exposure of JWT Token Custom Claims

**Description:**

In the JWT callback:

```ts
token.role = user.role;
token.avatar = user.avatar;
```

- User information is stored in the JWT token, which is sent to the client. If the `role` claim is trusted for access control **without server-side validation**, a compromised token could be used.

**Risk:**

- **Medium:** Ensure that role-based authorization is validated server-side and never trusts client-side tokens alone.

**Recommendation:**

- Always perform server-side authorization checks. Limit sensitive information stored in JWT claims.

---

### 6. NEXTAUTH_SECRET Loaded from Environment

**Description:**

```ts
secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
```

- If `process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is undefined, NextAuth may warn but can fall back to a default insecure value.

**Risk:**

- **Medium:** Sessions may be severely compromised if a strong secret is not set.

**Recommendation:**

- Make sure the secret is strongly defined in all environments.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                           | Severity | Description                              | Recommendation            |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Hardcoded master password ("password")  | Critical | Allows anyone to bypass authentication   | Remove master password    |
| Password hashes stored in code          | High     | Source leakage = password compromise     | Store externally          |
| (Potential) User enumeration via errors | Medium   | Attackers could confirm valid users      | Generic messages          |
| No rate limiting                        | Medium   | Enables brute-force login attempts       | Add throttling            |
| Token claim exposure                    | Medium   | JWT claims could be tampered client-side | Always verify server-side |
| No check on NEXTAUTH_SECRET             | Medium   | Weak secrets = session token compromise  | Require strong secret     |

## Overall Assessment

**Do NOT** use this code in production as it contains critical authentication bypasses, insecure credential handling practices, and lacks fundamental attack mitigations. Even for demos, the use of a hardcoded master password is strongly discouraged.

---

**Remediation in order of priority:**

1. REMOVE the hardcoded `"password"` master password immediately.
2. Never store password hashes in source code, even in mock/test setups.
3. Implement rate limiting and generic error handling.
4. Always validate JWT claims server-side.
5. Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is required and set to a secure value.
