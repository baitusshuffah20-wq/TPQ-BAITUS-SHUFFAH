# Security Vulnerabilities Report

**Subject**: TypeScript Code Review — TPQ Management System Behavior Data Models  
**Scope**: Security Vulnerabilities Only

---

## Executive Summary

This code primarily consists of static TypeScript types, interfaces, and helper functions. It does **not** include any sensitive business logic, authentication, direct database operations, input/output handlers, or untrusted code execution. However, in a broader context, the _usage_ of these models and certain helper functions could have security implications if not handled properly, especially with regard to data insertion, transformation, or exposure in a production application.

## Potential Security Issues

### 1. **Unsafe Handling of User-Provided URLs**

Evidence:

```typescript
attachments?: {
    type: "PHOTO" | "VIDEO" | "DOCUMENT";
    url: string;
    description: string;
}[];
```

- **Issue**: The `attachments[].url` property is a free-form string. Helper functions or consumers of this model could use this field for image/video/document embedding in a frontend. If user-controllable, this could lead to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) or content injection if URLs are not validated and sanitized.
- **Recommendation**: Validate that all URLs are safe, belong to expected domains, and are not of the type `javascript:` or data URLs. When rendering these in a frontend, always escape or sanitize output.

### 2. **Unvalidated & Unparsed Dates and Times**

Evidence:

```typescript
export const formatBehaviorDate = (date: string): string => {
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString("id-ID", ...);
};
export const formatBehaviorTime = (time: string): string => {
  return new Date(`1970-01-01T${time}`).toLocaleTimeString(...);
};
```

- **Issue**: Directly constructing `Date` objects from untrusted user data can allow for unexpected behavior, DOS (denial of service), or information disclosure if the string isn't validated and comes from a malicious source.
- **Recommendation**: Validate all date and time strings before usage. Use stricter parsing where possible and handle invalid values gracefully.

### 3. **Potential Information Disclosure**

- **Issue**: The `BehaviorRecord`, `BehaviorSummary`, and `CharacterGoal` interfaces contain several personally identifiable information (PII) fields (e.g., `santriName`, `santriNis`, `recordedByName`, etc.).
- **Recommendation**: Ensure data exposure is restricted based on user role and context. Never expose records with PII to unauthorized users. Implement strong access control at API/service layers.

### 4. **Open Metadata Fields**

Evidence:

```typescript
metadata?: {
    mood?: "HAPPY" | "SAD" | ...;
    ...
};
```

- **Issue**: This is not directly dangerous, but if the field structure evolves to allow arbitrary user-defined properties, it could be used for data smuggling or storing harmful content.
- **Recommendation**: Maintain a closed set of metadata fields; restrict extensibility unless specifically needed, and always validate their type and contents.

### 5. **No Field Constraints or Sanitization**

- **Issue**: Free-form strings like `description`, `title`, `notes`, `parentFeedback`, etc., are not constrained or sanitized in this model. If rendered on a UI, these could be used for XSS or reflected attacks if input is not properly escaped/sanitized by downstream services.
- **Recommendation**: Apply input sanitization and output encoding/escaping in the UI and API layers consuming these models.

### 6. **Template Criteria Assignment**

Evidence:

```typescript
criteria: BEHAVIOR_CRITERIA.filter((c) => c.category === "AKHLAQ");
// or
criteria: BEHAVIOR_CRITERIA;
```

- **Issue**: If the criteria assignment (via filter or direct array usage) ever depends on user input in the application layer, there is a risk of privilege escalation, excessive data exposure, or excessive object mutation.
- **Recommendation**: Keep all template manipulations on the server side, restrict the ability of end-users to create or modify templates or criteria.

## Summary Table

| Issue                         | Risk if Misused       | Recommended Mitigation           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Unvalidated URL fields        | XSS/Content injection | Enforce strict URL validation    |
| Unvalidated date/time parsing | DOS, logic error      | Validate and sanitize input      |
| Information disclosure (PII)  | Data leak             | Access control, minimal exposure |
| Unconstrained string fields   | XSS/Injection         | Input/output sanitization        |
| Open metadata fields          | Data smuggling        | Restrict/validate fieldset       |
| Template criteria assignment  | Excessive access      | Enforce strict permissions       |

## Final Note

**None of the issues above are directly exploitable in this static file**—all risks arise when these models and functions are integrated with application logic and untrusted user input. Strict validation, output encoding, and robust API-layer access control are necessary at integration points to ensure security.

**Please treat this report as a guidance for future integration with business logic and API/Frontend handling.**
