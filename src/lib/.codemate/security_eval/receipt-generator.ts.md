# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Reviewed

The report analyzes the `generateReceiptHTML` and `generateReceiptNumber` functions for security vulnerabilities. The core focus is on possible attacks resulting from insufficient data validation or unsafe coding practices, especially concerning HTML generation and dynamic data insertion.

---

## 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Vulnerability

**Context:**
The `generateReceiptHTML` function uses template literals to interpolate arbitrary data from a `ReceiptData` object directly into an HTML string, rendering it for later use (likely client output or PDF generation).

**Problem:**
Several fields from the `data` object are interpolated into the HTML without any form of escaping or sanitization. This means that if any property contains malicious HTML or JavaScript, it will be injected directly into the generated HTML.

#### Example Fields at Risk

- `data.receiptNumber`
- `data.santri.name`
- `data.santri.nis`
- `data.spp.period`
- `data.payment.method`
- `data.payment.account`
- `data.notes` (especially dangerous as this may contain arbitrary input)

**Consequences:**
If user-controllable data makes it into any of these fields, attackers can inject HTML or JavaScript that:

- Executes code in the user's browser
- Steals session cookies
- Defaces the HTML content

---

### Example Attack

If an attacker is able to set `data.notes` to `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`, this will trigger a JavaScript alert upon page load, demonstrating a stored XSS.

---

## 2. Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization

### Vulnerability

**Context:**
The functions do not validate or sanitize any incoming values from `ReceiptData` before rendering them into HTML.

**Problem:**
It is trivial to supply unexpected or malicious data, leading to XSS (as above) or malformed markup. Even if you trust your backend, if this feature is ever exposed to external sources (API inputs, integrations, form submissions), it becomes exploitable.

---

## 3. Unescaped HTML in `notes` Field

### Vulnerability

**Context:**
The `notes` field is optional and is rendered as:

```js
<div class="notes-content">${data.notes}</div>
```
````

**Problem:**
This field is _especially_ likely to contain rich user input, including attempted formatting or copy/paste content. Since it is inserted verbatim, it is a high-probability XSS vector. There are no restrictions on length, allowed tags, or characters.

---

## 4. No Content Security Policy

### Vulnerability

**Context:**
The generated HTML page does not include a Content-Security-Policy (CSP) meta tag to help mitigate the impact of XSS.

**Problem:**
While CSP cannot prevent XSS if rendering is already unsafe, it can significantly reduce the exploitability by blocking inline scripts or third-party code execution.

---

## 5. Generation of Unique Receipt Numbers

### Risk Assessment

**Context:**
The `generateReceiptNumber` function creates a receipt number based on date/time and a 2-digit random component.

**Problem:**
While not directly a OWASP vulnerability, insufficient randomness could in theory lead to predictable receipt numbers/IDs, which may in some integrations be abused for enumeration or information leakage. Not a critical flaw in this local context.

---

# Recommendations

### 1. Sanitize All User Data

Before interpolating any user-supplied data into the HTML, escape special HTML characters (`<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) to prevent script injection.

- Use a proper HTML-escaping utility for all interpolated values.
- Consider whitelisting allowed HTML if "rich text" is truly needed in `notes`.

### 2. Validate Input Types

Validate that values conform to expected types and formats before use (e.g., names and IDs should be alphanumeric, account fields limited, etc.).

### 3. Restrict/Strip HTML in Notes

If users do not need to enter HTML, strip all HTML tags from the `notes` field before rendering. Use a library like `sanitize-html` if rich text is required.

### 4. Include Content Security Policy

Add a `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" ...>` header to the generated HTML to reduce XSS attack surface.

### 5. Consider Stronger Receipt Number Entropy

If these IDs have any security/logical value, consider using a cryptographically secure random string or a UUID, not just a timestamp plus two random digits.

# Summary Table

| Vulnerability               | Affected Code/Field     | Severity | Description                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| XSS via unescaped input     | All interpolated fields | High     | No escaping, direct HTML injection       |
| XSS via notes               | `data.notes`            | High     | Arbitrary HTML allowed in notes          |
| Lack of input validation    | All input fields        | Medium   | No type/range/whitelist checking         |
| No CSP header               | Generated HTML          | Medium   | Allows inline scripts to run freely      |
| Predictable receipt numbers | `generateReceiptNumber` | Low      | Semi-predictable IDs (not critical here) |

---

# Final Word

**The main and most critical issue is the possibility of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of output escaping on all interpolated data fields. Any untrusted or user-provided data must be sanitized/escaped prior to inclusion in a raw HTML string.**

> **Recommendation:** Refactor the `generateReceiptHTML` function to sanitize all interpolated data and add a CSP meta-tag as a defense-in-depth measure.
