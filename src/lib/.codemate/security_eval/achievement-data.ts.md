# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Analyzed

The code consists of TypeScript interfaces, static data for achievement badges, and several helper functions related to categorizing and filtering badges for a badge/achievement system.

---

## Vulnerability Overview

Below is an analysis highlighting only **security vulnerabilities** found within the provided code.

---

### 1. Potential Denial of Service (DoS) via Large/Complex `customData` (Untrusted Input)

**Location:**  
Within the function `checkAchievementCriteria`:

```typescript
case "CUSTOM":
  actualValue = santriData.customData?.[badge.id] || 0;
  break;
```

**Details:**  
`customData` (type: `any`) is accessed without validation or sanitization. If `santriData` is user-controllable and can pass complex objects or functions, it could cause unexpected behavior or even DoS through prototype pollution (e.g., `{ __proto__: { badge_id: 99999 } }`), or by using malicious getter functions.

- **Impact:** Potential for user to craft objects that break processing logic, crash the system, or cause prototype pollution attacks.
- **Mitigation:** Strongly validate and sanitize incoming `customData` before accessing or integrating with application logic.

---

### 2. Lack of Type/Value Restrictions on Helper Functions (Information Disclosure, Insecure Operations)

**Location:**
Helper functions such as `getRarityColor`, `getCategoryColor`, `getBadgesByCategory`, etc., accept a parameter of type `string`.

Example:

```typescript
export const getBadgesByCategory = (category: string): AchievementBadge[] => {
  if (category === "all") return ACHIEVEMENT_BADGES;
  return ACHIEVEMENT_BADGES.filter((badge) => badge.category === category);
};
```

**Details:**  
Parameters are loosely typed as `string` instead of the expected union type (`"HAFALAN" | "ATTENDANCE" | ...`). If user input is passed directly, this could allow unexpected behavior, such as retrieval of all badges or failed filtering. While this is not immediately a direct security risk, it creates potential for **information disclosure** if these helpers are exposed in an API unchecked.

- **Impact:** Malicious users could attempt to enumerate or retrieve badge data outside intended visibility.
- **Mitigation:** Enforce stricter parameter type constraints and validate inputs against expected enums or values.

---

### 3. Potential Exposure of Sensitive URLs (Information Disclosure)

**Location:**  
Inside `SantriAchievement` interface:

```typescript
certificateUrl?: string;
```

**Details:**  
If this value is referenced or exposed in a context where user manipulation is possible, it might be possible to inject external or malicious URLs (e.g., pointing to phishing sites or malicious downloads).

- **Impact:** May enable Open Redirect or phishing attacks if certificateUrl is constructed from untrusted input elsewhere.
- **Mitigation:** Always validate and sanitize URLs before displaying or linking in any user-facing context.

---

### 4. Use of Unrestricted `any` Type in `customData`

**Location:**  
Inside both `SantriAchievement` interface and related logic:

```typescript
customData?: any;
```

**Details:**  
The `any` type offers no restrictionsâ€”it could be an object, function, or any data structure. If downstream code is not careful, this could open logic to **prototype pollution**, runtime errors, or even injection vulnerabilities (e.g., indirect data flow into external libraries or template engines).

- **Impact:** Prototype pollution, unexpected errors, or possible injection if the data is used unsafely downstream.
- **Mitigation:** Change `any` to a more restrictive type, and sanitize/validate customData before use.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                              | Location                 | Impact                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Unchecked `customData` access              | checkAchievementCriteria | DoS, Prototype pollution                 |
| Loose typing/user input in filters/helpers | Filtering functions      | Information disclosure, logic flaws      |
| Possible trust in unvalidated URLs         | SantriAchievement        | Open redirect, phishing, data leakage    |
| Unrestricted `any` type (`customData`)     | Interfaces and functions | Prototype pollution, code injection risk |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Avoid using `any` for user or external data.**  
   Define strict types and validate structures before processing, especially for custom fields.

2. **Validate all function parameters expected to be enums.**  
   Use literal types or runtime input validation to reject unexpected values.

3. **Sanitize URLs before use.**  
   If URLs are ever outputted, make sure they originate from trusted sources or are validated.

4. **Refactor data structures to prevent prototype pollution.**  
   Check object keys before access, and never trust incoming objects directly.

---

## Final Note

While the code does not contain direct code injection/command execution vulnerabilities, its reliance on unvalidated dynamic data (especially via `any` usage and loose filtering) opens it up to a range of **security issues if user input is incorporated without validation**. Strong typing, validation, and sanitization are critical to prevent exploitation as the system evolves.
