# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## Codebase: `WaliDashboard` React Component

This security review inspects the provided code for vulnerabilities related to authentication, session handling, data exposure, injection, and other common issues. The focus is on **security vulnerabilities only**.

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### Issue: **Client-Side Only Authorization**

- **Context:**  
  The code uses `useSession()` from NextAuth and checks for user roles (`session?.user.role !== "WALI"`) to determine if a user can view the dashboard.
- **Vulnerability:**  
  **Authorization checks are enforced on the client only.** A user with malicious intent can bypass the JavaScript logic and potentially access the page if server-side routes aren’t properly protected. Sensitive data could be exposed through SSR APIs or direct queries.
- **Recommendation:**  
  **Authorization and authentication must always be performed server-side.** This includes:
  - Using Next.js middleware, API route-level checks, or `getServerSideProps`/`getServerSession` to verify the session and user role before rendering any sensitive content or serving any API responses.
  - Never rely on client-side role checks for access control.

---

## 2. Sensitive Data Handling

### Issue: **Potential Sensitive Data Exposure in Client Bundle**

- **Context:**  
  The code includes "mock data" for children, messages, payments, etc. While this is not a vulnerability when using placeholders, if real user/session data is passed in or if mock data is replaced by real data from APIs, sensitive information may be embedded directly in client-rendered JavaScript.
- **Vulnerability:**  
  **Sensitive data (e.g. names, NIS, payments, messages) may be exposed to any user who can access the client bundle or API if not properly protected.**
- **Recommendation:**
  - All sensitive data must be fetched server-side with robust access controls.
  - Avoid exposing unnecessary PII or financial details client-side.
  - Never expose secrets or credentials in client bundles.

---

## 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Issue: **Potential for Rendering User-Provided Content Unsafely**

- **Context:**  
  Fields such as `session.user.name`, `message.subject`, `message.message`, and `child.name` are rendered as-is.
- **Vulnerability:**  
  If these fields are ever populated with data not under strict application control (e.g., if messages come from users or external APIs), there is a **risk of XSS** if values are not sanitized. React does escape contents by default, but this assumes no usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or third-party libraries that could circumvent escaping.
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary—and then, sanitize inputs first.**
  - Ensure all external data, especially messages, names, etc., are properly validated and sanitized at source.
  - If data may include rich text, use a sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify).

---

## 4. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

### Issue: **IDs Used on Client without Server Validation**

- **Context:**  
  The UI references items by numeric or string IDs (e.g., child id, payment id) but there are **no enforced server-side checks**.
- **Vulnerability:**  
  If future API calls (e.g., to mark a message as read, pay a bill) use these IDs directly from the client, improper checks could allow an authenticated user to reference and manipulate other users' data.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Ensure that all mutative or data-fetching API endpoints **strictly validate ownership and session-based access on the server.**
  - Do not allow client-supplied IDs to operate on objects without confirming session-user ownership.

---

## 5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### Issue: **No CSRF Protection for Mutative Actions**

- **Context:**  
  While the current dashboard only displays data, there are components (e.g., "Bayar", "Balas", "Tandai Dibaca" buttons) that imply future API mutations.
- **Vulnerability:**  
  If any API routes that mutate data are added and are not protected by CSRF tokens, malicious websites could cause users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Recommendation:**
  - For all POST, PUT, DELETE (and sometimes GET) endpoints, enforce CSRF protections using NextAuth or an appropriate library.
  - Use double-submit cookies or same-site cookies for API authentication.

---

## 6. Security Headers & Clickjacking

### Issue: **No Security Headers Enforced**

- **Context:**  
  The code does not set any security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options) that would mitigate XSS or clickjacking threats.
- **Vulnerability:**  
  Unless enforced at the framework/server level, your app is susceptible to UI redress attacks.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Set appropriate security headers at the HTTP or Next.js config level.
  - Use a strict Content Security Policy.
  - Use `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`.

---

## 7. Unvalidated/Unescaped Data in Currency, Dates, etc.

### Issue: **Assumption That Utility Functions Are Safe**

- **Context:**  
  Use of `toLocaleDateString`, `Intl.NumberFormat`, etc., on data from external sources.
- **Vulnerability:**  
  If raw/untrusted data (e.g., date values) comes from potentially manipulated sources, it can throw errors or cause UI disruption—though less likely to cause direct security issues.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Always validate and sanitize external data before formatting/parsing.

---

## 8. Third Party Packages

### Issue: **Unreviewed Third-Party UI Libraries**

- **Context:**  
  Components are imported from packages like `lucide-react` and custom UI kits.
- **Vulnerability:**  
  UI libraries occasionally have vulnerabilities or insecure defaults. This code depends on their safety.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Monitor all third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities and updates (use tools like `npm audit`).
  - Limit imported features to what is necessary.

---

## 9. Lack of Rate Limiting or Abuse Prevention

### Issue: **Potential Brute-Force/AUTZ Abuse Points**

- **Context:**  
  No mention of API rate limiting or brute-force protections.
- **Vulnerability:**  
  If endpoints (e.g., login, pay, mark as read) are added, they could be subject to abuse unless protection is implemented.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Implement rate limiting (e.g., per IP, per session) for all API endpoints.

# Conclusions & Action Items

- **DO NOT rely on client-side checks for access control; always require server-side validation for authentication and authorization.**
- **Ensure data exposure is minimal and always protected by server-side access checks.**
- **Sanitize and escape any user or external content, especially if exposing rich text.**
- **Enforce proper security headers and future-proof for CSRF and API security.**

For a production deployment, **do a full audit** of all client/server API boundaries, data exposure routes, and user input surfaces, and implement the above recommendations.
