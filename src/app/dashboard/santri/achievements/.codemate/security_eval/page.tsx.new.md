# Security Vulnerability Report

## Codebase: SantriAchievementsPage (React/Next.js)

---

## 1. **Unvalidated & Unsafe File Download**

### Location

```js
const handleDownloadCertificate = (achievement: SantriAchievement) => {
  if (achievement.certificateUrl) {
    window.open(achievement.certificateUrl, '_blank');
  } else {
    toast.error('Sertifikat belum tersedia');
  }
};
```

#### **Vulnerability**

**Open Redirect and Arbitrary File Download/Script Execution**  
The function opens whatever URL is supplied in `achievement.certificateUrl` in a new browser tab. If the `certificateUrl` is not strictly controlled (could be attacker-controlled or untrusted), this opens up the risk for:

- Malicious sites being opened (phishing, malware, etc.)
- Downloading or executing malicious files
- Bypassing Content Security Policy (CSP)/SameSite policies depending on context

#### **Recommendation**

- Only allow URLs from known, trusted domains (ideally, only within your server/CSP domain).
- Use an allow-list or regex check to validate URLs.
- Prefer downloading files by proxying their content via a trusted backend, rather than opening raw URLs on the client.

---

## 2. **Clipboard Injection via `navigator.clipboard.writeText`**

### Location

```js
const handleShareAchievement = (achievement: SantriAchievement) => {
  const badge = ACHIEVEMENT_BADGES.find(b => b.id === achievement.badgeId);

  if (badge && navigator.share) {
    navigator.share({
      title: `Achievement: ${badge.name}`,
      text: badge.shareMessage,
      url: window.location.href
    });
  } else {
    const message = badge?.shareMessage || `Saya telah mendapatkan badge ${achievement.badgeName}!`;
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(message);
    toast.success('Pesan berhasil disalin ke clipboard!');
  }
};
```

#### **Vulnerability**

**Clipboard Injection**  
Values written to the clipboard (`message`) depend on badge data or user data. If any of these values can be manipulated (server-side or via future programming mistakes), untrusted content could be written to the clipboard. In certain browser/OS combinations, this may be abused by phishing or social engineering.

#### **Recommendation**

- Ensure `badge.name`, `badge.shareMessage`, and `achievement.badgeName` can't be set to arbitrary (potentially malicious) content.
- Prefer limiting clipboard content to controlled templates/sanitized strings.
- Consider additional user confirmation before writing to the clipboard.

## 3. **Potential XSS in Unescaped User Data**

### Location

While the main rendered output of the page appears to display data such as `CURRENT_SANTRI.name`, `badge.name`, `badge.description`, etc., **React escapes most values by default**. However, there may be a risk if any of the components (`AchievementBadge`, `AchievementProgress`, etc.) use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or otherwise introduce unescaped HTML.

#### **Vulnerability**

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
If any of the data (`badge.name`, `badge.description`, `achievement.badgeName`, etc.) can contain untrusted input and is rendered with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or interpolated into raw HTML, an attacker could inject scripts.

#### **Recommendation**

- Verify all nested components escape user content.
- Avoid or tightly control any usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Sanitize any server-provided content.

---

## 4. **Lack of Authorization Check**

### Location

```js
// Using mock data for CURRENT_SANTRI and achievements.
```

#### **Vulnerability**

**Horizontal Privilege Escalation**  
The function assumes CURRENT_SANTRI cannot be tampered with; however, in a real application, if achievement data or user IDs are supplied from client-side state or APIs without server-side access controls, a malicious user could query or manipulate another user's data.

#### **Recommendation**

- Enforce backend-side session and access controls for any sensitive data.
- Never trust client-provided identifiers.
- Filter and authorize access to resources on the server.

---

## 5. **Information Disclosure via Leaderboard**

### Location

```js
const MOCK_LEADERBOARD = [ ... ];
```

#### **Vulnerability**

Displaying other users' names and NIS numbers in a leaderboard may lead to:

- **Personal information exposure** if data is sensitive or not public.

#### **Recommendation**

- Limit displayed PII as much as possible.
- Provide settings for users to opt-in/-out of leaderboard exposure.
- Mask or pseudonymize information if required by privacy policy.

---

## 6. **No Input Validation on Filters/Search**

### Location

```js
<input ... value={searchTerm} onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)} />
// Category/selects on filter
```

#### **Vulnerability**

- Although values are stored in state, if the filter or search values are used directly in queries (in serverside code) without validation, it may introduce **injection attacks** (e.g. SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection).

#### **Recommendation**

- Always validate and sanitize inputs before using in database/API queries.
- For this mock/client scenario, risk is low, but it is an important consideration for future API or backend integration.

---

## 7. **External Files/Images with No CSP or Validation**

### Location

```js
photo: '/images/santri/ahmad.jpg',
certificateUrl: '/certificates/ahmad_first_surah.pdf',
```

#### **Vulnerability**

If remote/user-uploaded images or files are not validated, could allow upload or serving of malicious scripts/content.

#### **Recommendation**

- Strictly validate file uploads.
- Enforce MIME type checking.
- Use strong Content Security Policies (CSP) to prevent attacks via malicious files.

# **Security Recommendations**

1. **Never trust client-side data or input**â€”all access control must be enforced by the backend.
2. **Whitelist and sanitize all file URLs and user-facing data.**
3. **Escape all output** and avoid any use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless strictly necessary and safely handled.
4. **Implement privacy controls** for any public views of user data.
5. **Validate all form/filter input** before using with backend/API/database.
6. **Enforce strong CSP** in your Next.js app to mitigate XSS and content injection.
