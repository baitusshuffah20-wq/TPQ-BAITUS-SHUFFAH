# Security Vulnerability Report

### Target: `MusyrifSantriPage` React Component

---

## 1. **Exposure of Sensitive Data**

**Description:**  
The component exposes sensitive personal information directly in the UI, including:

- Students' full names
- NIS (presumably student identification numbers)
- Phone numbers
- Addresses
- Parent names

Sensitive data such as phone numbers and addresses should not be rendered unless absolutely necessary, and their exposure increases the risk of data leakage, especially if the application does not have strong access control.

**Recommendation:**

- Ensure proper access control so that only authorized users can view sensitive details.
- If possible, minimize the display of sensitive fields in UI.
- Mask or partly obfuscate personal identifiers and contact information where possible.

---

## 2. **Lack of Output Encoding (XSS Risk)**

**Description:**  
Although React by default escapes strings in JSX, always review the source of all rendered user data. In this code, all data is from a static array, mitigating the immediate risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). However, if `santriList` is ever populated with external data, the following lines could be susceptible:

```tsx
<span className="text-teal-600 font-semibold">
  {santri.name.split(" ").map((n) => n[0]).join("")}
</span>
...
{santri.name}
{santri.nis}
{santri.halaqah}
{santri.lastHafalan}
{santri.phone}
{santri.address}
...
```

If any field comes from an untrusted source and is rendered in the UI, there is a potential for XSS.

**Recommendation:**

- Ensure all values are sanitized before display.
- Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless sanitized.
- Consider using libraries like `DOMPurify` if you need to render rich text from user input.
- Avoid trusting client-generated data.

---

## 3. **Unvalidated Input (Client-Side Filtering)**

**Description:**  
The search and filter functionalities operate entirely on client-side data. While this is fine for static data, if applied to server-side data, this could expose filtering logic to tampering and may facilitate enumeration attacks.

**Recommendation:**

- Always validate and sanitize any input on the server, especially if search/filter functionality is implemented server-side in the future.
- Implement rate limiting and monitoring to detect abuse.

---

## 4. **Personal Data Exposure in Logs or Errors**

**Description:**  
While not present in the provided code, if any error logs, debugging tools, or error messages output `santriList` directly, this could cause exposure of personal data.

**Recommendation:**

- Never log sensitive user data in console/logs.
- Ensure that error handling does not leak sensitive payloads.

---

## 5. **Absence of Authorization Controls**

**Description:**  
There is no evidence in this component of checks for user roles or access levels. It assumes that `useAuth()`'s `user` context is correctly scoped, but does not enforce any logic restricting access to student data.

**Recommendation:**

- Implement server-side authorization: ensure that the current user may only access data they are permitted to see.
- Use API endpoints that validate the user’s privilege before returning sensitive information.

---

## 6. **Potential Overexposure via Enumeration**

**Description:**  
The list of students is served to the page unfiltered. If this design is extended to server-rendered (SSR) or static site generation (SSG), a user could enumerate the list and scrape all students’ details.

**Recommendation:**

- Implement paging and rate limiting.
- Use backend endpoints that return only the subset of data the user has access to, based on their session/role.
- Consider audit logging access to sensitive records.

---

## 7. **Lack of Data Privacy Compliance**

**Description:**  
The display of student personal information (especially for minors) may violate local data privacy laws if not managed with explicit consent, given the types of data processed.

**Recommendation:**

- Ensure you have explicit consent to process and display such information.
- Follow country-specific regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

# Final Notes

While the current version only uses static mock data, **all security risks described become critical** when connecting to real data sources or running in production. Always assume that:

- Data can be tampered with;
- Users may not have legitimate access to all records;
- Browsers and clients can be manipulated.

**Address these risks before deploying with real user data.**
