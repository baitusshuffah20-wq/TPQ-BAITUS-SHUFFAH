## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Untrusted Data Rendered via User-Entered Error Logs

**a. Direct Data Rendering without Escaping**

- The following fields are rendered directly inside the DOM:
  - `log.message`
  - `log.context`
  - `log.url`
  - `log.userAgent`
  - `log.stack`
- **Risk:** If malicious or unescaped data makes it into these fields, attackers could inject arbitrary HTML or scripts (XSS).
- **Mitigation:** Ensure all data rendered into the UI – especially `log.message`, `log.context`, `log.url`, and details in the expanded view (stack traces, metadata, etc.) – is sanitized or strictly validated on the server so it cannot include executable JavaScript or unwanted HTML.

**Relevant code snippets:**

```jsx
<h3 className="font-medium text-gray-900">
  {log.message}
</h3>
...
{log.context && (
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1">
    <span className="font-medium">Konteks:</span>{" "}
    {log.context}
  </p>
)}
```

- **Additional Risk:** The `<pre>` tags for stacktraces and metadata (e.g., parsed JSON) will display strings as-is. Preformatted tags do generally prevent HTML rendering, **but** if there's ever a React bug or misconfiguration, or if a library is switched, this could become an XSS risk.

### 2. Blindly Parsing and Rendering `log.metadata`

**b. Use of `JSON.parse` on `log.metadata`**

- The metadata is parsed via `JSON.parse(log.metadata)`. If the backend does not strictly control and validate this string, this could lead to errors or even prototype pollution (if another location of the app is vulnerable).
- **Mitigation:** Always validate and sanitize `metadata` on the backend and expect only JSON-serializable data. When displaying, surround in `<pre>{...}</pre>` as is done, but be wary of any possible injection scenario or library changes.

**Snippet:**

```jsx
<pre className="text-xs bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded overflow-x-auto">
  {JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(log.metadata), null, 2)}
</pre>
```

### 3. No Authorization or CSRF Protections in API Interactions

**c. Unprotected API Endpoints**

- The `handleResolve` and `handleDelete` methods POST to URLs like `/api/admin/error-logs/resolve` and `/api/admin/error-logs/delete`. The implementation of these endpoints is not shown, but if CSRF protection or authorization requirements are missing, attackers could trigger state changes as the logged-in admin.
- **Mitigation:** Ensure all endpoints require proper authentication AND authorization.
- **Mitigation:** Implement CSRF tokens/mechanisms in the backend for all state-changing routes.

---

### 4. No Input Validation on Outbound Requests

**d. Blindly Using User/Client Data**

- The `id` field for resolve/delete actions is sent directly to the API with no client-side validation. If possible, users could manipulate the `id` (e.g., via browser dev tools) to target arbitrary logs or even inject malformed data.
- **Mitigation:** Validate all parameters (such as `id`) server-side; never rely on client logic for resource access control or validation.

---

### 5. Unfiltered Search Query

**e. Unrestricted Filtering & Searching**

- The search feature allows filtering/log lookup by arbitrary input. While this is not a direct vulnerability, if search queries are used to build server-side queries/filters, consider SQL injection or path traversal mitigations on the backend. (This code appears client-only, but backend must validate or escape query parameters for any search functionality.)

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                    | Description                                                                                   | Mitigation                                      |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **XSS**                          | Raw rendering of server-controlled log content (message, context, stack, userAgent, metadata) | Sanitize input/output; never render as raw HTML |
| **Prototype Pollution**          | Rendering/using untrusted JSON with `JSON.parse`                                              | Validate/sanitize metadata on server            |
| **CSRF/Authorization**           | No visible CSRF or auth on API requests (`resolve`, `delete`)                                 | Implement CSRF & check auth on backend          |
| **Unvalidated Input**            | Use of untrusted `id` parameters                                                              | Validate all params server-side                 |
| **Backend Injection (e.g. SQL)** | Reliance on search query user input (indirect, if used for backend filtering)                 | Sanitize and use prepared statements, etc.      |

## Recommendations

1. **Sanitize and escape all untrusted data** from logs before rendering in the UI.
2. **Never trust frontend input**: always validate resource IDs, search queries, and any client-supplied data server-side before use.
3. **Protect all API endpoints** with strict admin-level authentication and CSRF protection; do not rely on frontend checks.
4. **Audit all backend endpoints** to ensure input is properly escaped (to prevent injection attacks of any form).
5. **Ensure proper error handling:** Avoid leaking sensitive details in logs or responses (stacktraces, system details, etc.).
6. **Monitor dependencies and component usage:** If for some reason a future refactor uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or risky React props, re-audit for XSS.

## Conclusion

While the client-side code itself is mostly only at risk for XSS due to its rendering of possibly server-controlled log data, the most serious vulnerabilities depend on the security of the backend APIs it interacts with (and how much user content from untrusted sources can reach the logs). If any log data is ingesting user input from the wider Internet, **strong cross-site scripting and injection protections should be in place both server- and client-side**.
