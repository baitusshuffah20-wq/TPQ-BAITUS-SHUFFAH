# High-Level Documentation for Custom 404 Not Found Page Component

## Overview

This code defines a custom "Not Found" (404) page React component intended for use in a Next.js application. It displays a user-friendly message when a page is not found, provides navigation options, and logs the error for tracking purposes.

## Features

### 1. **UI Presentation**

- **Visual display:** The page shows a "404" icon in a colored circle, a prominent "Page Not Found" heading, a brief explainer message, and the URL that could not be found.
- **Navigation options:**
  - **Back to Home:** Button navigates to the homepage (`/`) using Next.js `Link`.
  - **Go Back:** Button uses the browser history to navigate back.

### 2. **Error Logging**

- **Automatic error reporting:** When this page is rendered in production, it sends a POST request to `/api/error-logger` with details about the 404 error, including:
  - The missing URL (pathname)
  - Error severity and context
  - Timestamp
  - User agent string
- **Failsafes:** Uses try-catch to avoid disrupting UX if logging fails and only performs logging in production to avoid unnecessary logs during development.

### 3. **Tech Stack & Dependencies**

- **React** for UI rendering.
- **Next.js** hooks and routing for pathname and navigation.
- **Lucide-react** for iconography.
- **Custom Button component** for consistent styling.
- **Optional error handler import** for future extensibility.

### 4. **Styling**

- Uses utility-first classes (likely Tailwind CSS) for consistent spacing, typography, colors, and responsive layout.

## Usage Context

This component is intended to be used as the global 404 error page in a Next.js application, providing an upgraded UX over the default error page and promoting improved observability for missing routes.
