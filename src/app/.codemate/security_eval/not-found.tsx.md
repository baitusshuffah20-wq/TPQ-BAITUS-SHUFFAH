# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the provided React/Next.js code, specifically searching for security vulnerabilities. This analysis includes both client-side and potential implications for server-side processing (e.g., endpoints called via fetch).

---

## 1. Information Exposure via Client-Side Logging

### **Vulnerability: Exposing Sensitive Information**

**Line(s) affected:**

```js
body: JSON.stringify({
  message: `404 Page Not Found: ${pathname}`,
  severity: "WARNING",
  context: "Navigation",
  metadata: {
    url: pathname,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
  },
}),
```

**Description:**

- The code logs every 404 event to `/api/error-logger` and includes:
  - The requested URL (`pathname`)
  - The visitor's `userAgent`
  - A timestamp

**Considerations:**

- If `pathname` can contain sensitive data (e.g., IDs, tokens, or PII embedded in the URL path), this data is being sent to the error logger and potentially stored insecurely, especially if logged without filtering or truncation.
- If `userAgent` is logged and then rendered in admin dashboards or error log viewers without sanitization, it could be used for e.g. DOM-based XSS (see next).
- Over-logging client data may increase the risk surface if the error logger endpoint is not properly secured.

### **Recommendation:**

- **Sanitize and filter all logged data** before storage or display, especially `pathname` which comes from browser navigation and could be manipulated.
- **Avoid logging unnecessary information** (user agent strings are often not helpful at scale, and pathnames may contain sensitive user data).

## 2. Data Passed Directly to the Error Logger Endpoint

### **Vulnerability: Potential SSRF or Unexpected Data Injection (Server-Side)**

**Implication:**

- The endpoint `/api/error-logger` receives input directly from the client without any validation or limiting. If the endpoint is not hardened:
  - Attackers could cause it to log very large pathnames (log flooding).
  - They could inject malicious payloads (e.g., CRLF attacks in logs).
  - If the error-logger implementation processes data in an unsafe way, it may allow SSRF or file writes.

### **Recommendation:**

- **Validate and sanitize all fields** on the server before accepting or logging them.
- **Set reasonable limits** on data sizes (e.g., max path/userAgent/metadata lengths).
- **Consider using structured logging** to prevent log injection.

---

## 3. Rendering of Unescaped Pathname in UI

**Line(s) affected:**

```js
<p>URL: {pathname}</p>
```

**Description:**

- The code displays the `pathname` variable retrieved via `usePathname()` directly in the rendered 404 page.

**Considerations:**

- Normally React escapes embedded expressions to prevent XSS, but if the `pathname` ever contains a string that leads to React interpreting it as JSX (e.g., using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` elsewhere), or if another refactor later exposes the variable to unsanitized HTML output, XSS could occur.
- If some future library or context disables React escaping (unlikely, but possible in certain legacy contexts), then an attacker who can control the URL may inject malicious scripts.

### **Recommendation:**

- **Continue relying on React's default escaping.**
- As a defense-in-depth measure, **sanitize or encode the displayed pathname** if there's any risk of raw HTML output in the future.

## 4. No Evidence of CSRF Protection for Error Logger

**Vulnerability: CSRF Attacks on `/api/error-logger`**

**Implication:**

- The API endpoint `/api/error-logger` accepts POST requests from the front-end. If not appropriately protected, an attacker could trick a user into visiting a malicious site that causes their browser to POST to this endpoint (CSRF).

### **Recommendation:**

- Ensure the endpoint is protected with CSRF tokens or same-origin policy (e.g., only accepting requests with correct `Origin` headers, or authentication if applicable).
- Since error logging usually does not require authentication, ensure it cannot be abused for denial-of-service (DoS) or log flooding.

---

## 5. Unvalidated Data in Logs (Log Injection Risk)

**Description:**

- Because the 404 error is logged with user-supplied information, an attacker may be able to inject content (special characters, new lines) into logs if log output is not sanitized.

**Recommendation:**

- Always sanitize log entries for control characters and newlines.

---

## 6. Exposure of Browser Internals

**Description:**

```js
userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
```

- The user agent string is being sent with every 404 event.
- While not sensitive in itself, in aggregate this increases server log size and may risk log overflow, especially if user agents are spoofed to be excessively large by automated tools.

**Recommendation:**

- Truncate or validate user agent strings before logging.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                                           | Risk Level | Recommendation                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Logging potentially sensitive data from path/user-agent | Moderate   | Sanitize, validate, and filter logged data; limit PII exposure.    |
| Exposing user-controllable data to server logging       | Moderate   | Server-side validation and size-limiting required.                 |
| Rendering of path in UI                                 | Low        | React output is escaped by default, but be wary of future changes. |
| Possible CSRF on error logger API                       | Moderate   | Add CSRF/same-origin protections.                                  |
| Log injection risk                                      | Moderate   | Sanitize log entries for control chars/newlines.                   |
| User-Agent logging (log overflow/abuse)                 | Low        | Truncate/validate user agent strings logged.                       |

# **Conclusion & Remediation**

- The most significant risks are related to logging attacker-controllable data (`pathname`, `userAgent`) both in server logs and if ever displayed in admin UIs.
- **Action Items:**
  - Implement rigorous data validation and sanitization both client and server-side.
  - Ensure logging APIs are not vulnerable to CSRF or DoS (rate-limit, origin check, etc.).
  - Audit server-side error-logger for log injection and overlogging of PII/sensitive data.
  - Continue to rely on Reactâ€™s escaping for UI output, but sanitize data if requirements change.
