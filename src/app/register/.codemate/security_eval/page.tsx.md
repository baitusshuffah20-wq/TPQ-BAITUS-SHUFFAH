# Security Vulnerabilities Report for RegisterPage Component

## Overview

The provided code is a React functional component (`RegisterPage`) for a registration form. It is a multi-step form collecting personal and guardian data for a student ("santri") and program selection. The form does not submit or process data to a real backend but simulates a successful "registration" via a dummy `setTimeout` and shows an alert.

The following report highlights only **security vulnerabilities** (not logic bugs, UX issues, or suggestions regarding style or best practice).

---

## 1. **Client-Side Validation Only (No Server Enforcement)**

### Description

All validation and checks are implemented on the client side. There is no actual submission to a backend (the call is simulated via `setTimeout`). In a production system, **all validation and business logic must be repeated and enforced on the server**. Relying solely on client-side checking is a significant security vulnerability, as attackers can easily bypass these checks using network tools or by modifying JavaScript in the browser.

### Risk

- Attackers can submit invalid, malicious, or incomplete data.
- Service logic relying on valid input can be broken or compromised.
- Underscores trust in any sort of registration, payment, or identity process.

### Recommendation

**ALWAYS** validate and sanitize all user input on the server. Never trust exclusively client-side checks.

---

## 2. **No Input Sanitization or Escaping**

### Description

The code does not perform any sanitization or escaping of any field before sending it to the (simulated) backend, displaying it, or otherwise processing it. If these values are ever rendered anywhere (e.g., in email, page, or logs) without escaping, this opens up the application to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** and similar vulnerabilities.

While the code currently does not render user input elsewhere, this omission may propagate to real implementations.

### Risk

- Potential for XSS if user-provided inputs are rendered as HTML/JS in future pages, emails, or logs.
- Attackers can inject JavaScript payloads to hijack sessions, steal data, etc.

### Recommendation

- Escape all user input before rendering or logging.
- Validate and sanitize data as soon as it's received on the server.

---

## 3. **Untrusted Use of alert() for User Feedback**

### Description

The code uses the browser's `alert()` function to display messages with variable content. While this does not currently contain any user input, if user data were included in such messages, it could expose the application to XSS (e.g., `alert(formData.santriName)` with unsanitized input).

### Risk

- If user data is ever interpolated, attackers could trigger unwanted scripting in admin browsers.

### Recommendation

Never include raw user input in alert/dialog messages. Always sanitize or escape values, or better yet, use server-side validation for security-critical flows.

---

## 4. **No CSRF Protection (Potentially)**

### Description

While this is a client-only component and does not demonstrate data submission to a real endpoint, when adapted for a production Next.js app, **no anti-CSRF measures** are shown or mentioned. If you later POST data to an endpoint, omitting a CSRF token allows attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

### Risk

- State-changing actions (registration, data change) could be forged.

### Recommendation

- Always implement anti-CSRF tokens for POST requests (especially for authentication or registration routes).

---

## 5. **No Anti-Bot or CAPTCHA Controls**

### Description

There is no anti-automation/check in this registration form (such as CAPTCHA or rate-limiting). Bots could and will mass-submit forms if an endpoint is made public.

### Risk

- Spam registrations.
- Application resource exhaustion.
- Abuse of backend workflows (email, notifications, etc.).

### Recommendation

- Implement CAPTCHA or similar anti-bot verification.
- Add server-side rate limiting and abuse detection.

---

## 6. **Sensitive Data in the Front End**

### Description

Personal and guardian information (names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, birth details, etc.) are all captured directly in the frontend. Although this is unavoidable in many apps, it heightens the need for **careful transport, storage, and processing**.

### Risk

- Data sent via insecure connections can be sniffed.
- Data stored or logged insecurely can lead to privacy breaches.

### Recommendation

- Ensure all communication is over `HTTPS`.
- Never log sensitive PII without redaction on either frontend or backend.
- Map and audit where this information goes, including 3rd party services.

---

## 7. **No Email/Phone Validation or Anti-Abuse**

### Description

The code does not prevent input of invalid or fake email addresses or phone numbers. While not strictly a security vulnerability, it does open the app up to:

- Account enumeration.
- Unsolicited email/SMS triggering ("mail-bombing", spam).

### Recommendation

- Add validation and rate limiting to email/SMS sending endpoints.
- Implement email/phone verification where required.

---

## 8. **Potential Information Leakage via Errors**

### Description

Currently, error alerts are generic (`alert("Terjadi kesalahan. Silakan coba lagi.");`). If more granular error messages are ever added in the future, ensure they do not leak sensitive information (such as existence of other users, server details, etc.).

### Recommendation

- Keep error messages generic for untrusted users.
- Log detailed technical errors only on the server, never in the UI.

---

## 9. **Missing Accessibility for Error Reporting (Possible Clickjacking)**

### Description

All field error messages are rendered on the page, but thereâ€™s no ARIA attributes or explicit tagging for enhanced accessibility. Fields using dynamic error messages also could be used for clickjacking if user-supplied HTML is ever rendered.

### Recommendation

- Whenever possible, ensure error messages are text-only.
- Ensure that error rendering is not vulnerable to injection (see #2).

# Conclusion

**Most of the above security points refer to what is _missing_ rather than something directly exploitable in this code snippet.** The report assumes that this form will be connected to backend APIs and databases for a production system. Please ensure all actual data handling, storage, and processing is designed with these security measures in place, and that the recommendations above are followed before deployment.

---

**If you have a different set of input handling, or a backend implementation to review, additional vulnerabilities may be present depending on how data is stored, used, and returned.**
