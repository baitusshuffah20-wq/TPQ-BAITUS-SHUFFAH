# Security Vulnerability Report

This report analyzes the provided **DonationSuccessPage** React code for potential security vulnerabilities. It does **not** cover functionality, maintainability, performance, or style issues unless they specifically impact security.

---

## 1. **Exposure of Sensitive Data via URL Parameters**

### **Description**

- Donation data (such as `donorName`, `donorEmail`, `amount`, etc.) can be set directly from URL query parameters, especially in "devMode". Example:
  ```js
  const mockDonationData = {
    ...
    donorName: searchParams.get("donor_name") || "Donatur Anonim",
    donorEmail: searchParams.get("donor_email") || "anonymous@example.com",
    ...
  }
  ```
- This data is reflected into the page output without sanitization.

### **Risk**

- **Information Leakage**: Users can craft URLs revealing or spoofing donation details — even in development, this may accidentally reach production or leak via browser history, referer headers, logs, etc.
- Can be used for phishing/social engineering attacks (fake donor receipts or messages).
- If “devMode” is influenced by user-provided inputs, an attacker could force the app into “devMode”, potentially exposing more vectors.

### **Recommendation**

- Never trust client-provided data for displaying sensitive or trusted information, even in dev/test environments.
- Do NOT allow `devMode` to be enabled via a query parameter in production, or at all in deploys exposed to real users.
- Sanitize and validate all inputs, especially those that end up in output.

## 2. **Lack of Input Validation / Sanitization**

### **Description**

- Data incorporated from user-controlled sources (`searchParams`, fallback mock data, or API) is directly rendered in the React output:
  ```jsx
  {
    donationData.donorName;
  }
  {
    donationData.message;
  }
  ```
- Although React’s output is generally safe from XSS, if you ever refactor to include `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar APIs (or frameworks that do not escape data), you could introduce client-side XSS.

### **Risk**

- **Future Refactoring Risk**: If any unsafe rendering method is used, XSS becomes trivial.
- **API Data Trust**: If API is compromised or data externally injected/poisoned, it could return unsafe content.
- **Downstream Injections**: If the app reuses these values in emails, PDFs, or other places, a vulnerability could arise.

### **Recommendation**

- Always strictly validate and sanitize any external/user-controlled data before rendering or using elsewhere.
- Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized data.

## 3. **Unsecured Fetch to API Endpoint**

### **Description**

- The code fetches donation data client-side from `/api/donations/${orderId}` without any authentication or CSRF mechanism apparent in this snippet.
  ```js
  const response = await fetch(`/api/donations/${orderId}`);
  ```

### **Risk**

- If the API endpoint does **not** perform strict authentication/authorization:
  - Any visitor can pull data for any `orderId` value, potentially leaking donor info.
  - Attackers can enumerate donation IDs to scrape user data.
- CSRF risk if destructive endpoints are implemented similarly.

### **Recommendation**

- Ensure `GET /api/donations/:orderId` is always authenticated and strictly authorized on the server.
- Never expose sensitive donation or user data accessible via predictable identifiers without proper access control.
- Consider logging and rate-limiting if appropriate.

---

## 4. **Trust of Client-Side Rendering for Sensitive Inputs**

### **Description**

- The client component shows sensitive data (`donorEmail`, `reference`, etc.) on the frontend. If this is sensitive, it could be exposed to malicious users via:
  - Direct browser access
  - JavaScript scraping
  - XSS vulnerabilities (see above)

### **Risk**

- **Leakage of Donor Details**: Includes reference code, message to organization, and email addresses.
- Could facilitate phishing or social engineering attacks.
- If sensitive, this should only be revealed post-authentication/authorization.

### **Recommendation**

- Carefully consider what information should be included in a client-rendered confirmation page.
- Redact or mask sensitive fields as appropriate.
- If possible, implement session-based or token-based validation to restrict access to donation details (e.g., after successful payment only).

---

## 5. **Uncontrolled External URL Generation (WhatsApp Share)**

### **Description**

- The WhatsApp sharing function takes data from `donationData` (potentially containing attacker-provided content) to craft a rich message and sends it to an external URL:
  ```js
  window.open(whatsappUrl, "_blank");
  ```

### **Risk**

- **Open Redirect**: Not applicable here, as WhatsApp URLs are hardcoded.
- **Malicious Data Injection**: If `donationData.donorName` or `donationData.categoryName` can be attacker-controlled, they could inject misleading or offensive messages into the generated WhatsApp share text, with social consequences.
- Potential for reflected attacks if linked content embeds attacker-controlled data in messages that look official.

### **Recommendation**

- Sanitize all message contents.
- Escape dynamic fields appropriately (though WhatsApp typically just renders raw text).

---

## 6. **No Content Security Policy (CSP) or Security HTTP Headers**

### **Description**

- Not apparent in this snippet (since it is a React component), but it's critical to enforce appropriate security headers at the application or web server level:
  - CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, etc.

### **Risk**

- XSS, clickjacking, information leakage are more likely with default headers.

### **Recommendation**

- Ensure the deployment (Next.js app/server) enforces strict CSP and security headers.

---

## 7. **Potential IDOR via Reference Codes**

### **Description**

- If `reference` (donation ID) is not a random, unguessable string, users could attempt to discover and access other user’s donation details.

### **Risk**

- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**: Exposure of other users’ private information.

### **Recommendation**

- Ensure all resource identifiers are random and unguessable.
- Server-side endpoints must always check access control for the requesting user/session.

# **Action Plan**

- **Audit server endpoints for authentication, authorization, and access controls.**
- **Remove or tightly restrict all development/test modes for production deploys.**
- **Never trust or output URL parameters or unauthenticated API data to the UI.**
- **Sanitize all external inputs, especially any user-facing output.**
- **Control and restrict information shown on donation success; remove unnecessary sensitive fields.**
- **Ensure all client-server API interactions are secure, access-controlled, and do not leak data.**
- **Implement and monitor a content security policy and required HTTP security headers.**

---

# **Conclusion**

The main vulnerabilities in this code relate to excessive trust in client-side data sources, lack of robust authentication/authorization on API endpoints (as inferred), and exposure of sensitive information via UI and sharing features. Mitigation requires a combination of code, architectural, and infrastructure security practices as outlined above.
