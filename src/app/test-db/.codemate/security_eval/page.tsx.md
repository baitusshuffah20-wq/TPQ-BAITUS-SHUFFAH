# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Reviewed

A React/Next.js client-side page for running and displaying results of a suite of database and API “health” tests. Tests call backend endpoints (e.g., `/api/test/db`, `/api/halaqah`, etc.) and render their results to the user.

---

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. **Verbose Error Disclosure**

**Details:**  
Any error thrown during a test run (from API or database failures) is directly set as the `message` and/or included in the `details` field returned by the `runTest` function. These fields are then rendered in the UI.

**Code Example:**

```js
message: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Test gagal',
details: error,
...
<pre className="...">{JSON.stringify(result.details, null, 2)}</pre>
```

**Implications:**

- If backend errors or stack traces are included, sensitive implementation details could be leaked to users.
- This is especially critical if the error objects include database errors, internal API URLs, or stack traces.

---

### 2. **Unvalidated JSON Output**

**Details:**  
Result details from API responses are directly stringified and rendered:

```js
<pre className="...">{JSON.stringify(result.details, null, 2)}</pre>
```

**Implications:**

- If any of the API endpoints return unescaped or user-controlled HTML/JS (unlikely, but possible), and React's escaping fails for any reason (e.g., if component changes to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in future), it could allow stored/reflected XSS.
- Overly verbose API responses may expose more data than intended.

---

### 3. **Lack of Authentication/Authorization Checks**

**Details:**  
The page presumes that whoever can view it should be permitted to run backend diagnostic or health check endpoints. There is no evidence of authentication or user role checks.

**Implications:**

- Unauthorized users may probe internal APIs, enumerate backend error messages, and possibly overload backend services by repeated test runs.
- Attackers could use this UI to automate enumeration of available endpoints and system status, giving information for targeted attacks.

---

### 4. **API Endpoint Enumeration and Abuse**

**Details:**  
All endpoints (`/api/test/db`, `/api/halaqah`, etc.) are visible client-side, and can be automated via browser inspector or network tab even if the UI is hidden.

**Implications:**

- Attackers can see what internal endpoints exist and their parameters/response structures.
- They can launch automated attacks or fuzz these endpoints.

---

### 5. **Potential API Request Flooding (Denial of Service Risk)**

**Details:**  
There is minimal mitigation for rapid re-running of all API tests:

```js
<Button
  onClick={runAllTests}
  disabled={isRunning}
  ...
>
```

- Only a simple flag prevents concurrent test runs in a single session.

**Implications:**

- An attacker could still script repeated runs (bypassing UI state) to flood backend APIs, possibly leading to a denial of service or hitting rate limits.

---

### 6. **Missing Input Validation (for API Queries)**

**Details:**  
Some API fetches specify query params (e.g., `/api/halaqah?type=QURAN`) inline.

**Implications:**

- Currently not user-supplied, but if refactored in the future, lack of proper input sanitization could allow injection attacks.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Sanitize Error Output:**
   - Never expose raw exception messages or stack traces to end-users. Use generic error messages, and log sensitive details server-side.
2. **Validate & Sanitize JSON Output:**
   - Ensure API endpoints do not return excessive or sensitive information. Limit what is rendered in the UI.
3. **Add Authentication & Authorization:**
   - Restrict UI and all backend test endpoints to admin or trusted users.
4. **Obfuscate/Control Endpoint Exposure:**
   - Avoid hard-coding and exposing internal endpoint structures to the front-end if not necessary.
5. **Implement Rate Limiting/Throttling:**
   - Prevent excessive test execution. Consider backend-side rate limits on API health endpoints.
6. **Prepare for Future Input:**
   - If query params or payloads become user-driven, validate and sanitize all input to mitigate injection attacks.

| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Verbose Error Disclosure | Info leak            | Use generic messages; log sensitive server-side |
| Unvalidated JSON Output  | XSS/data exposure    | Sanitize/validate API data before rendering     |
| Lack of Auth/AuthZ       | Privilege escalation | Require admin login/role checks                 |
| API Endpoint Enumeration | Recon/targeting      | Minimize endpoint exposure; restrict info       |
| API Request Flooding     | DoS                  | Enforce rate limits at API & UI                 |

**Overall, this code is meant for diagnostic purposes, but if exposed to untrusted users, all above vulnerabilities should be addressed.**
