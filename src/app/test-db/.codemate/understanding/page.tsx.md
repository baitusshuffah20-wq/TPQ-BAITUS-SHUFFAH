# High-Level Documentation: Database & API Testing Component

## Overview

This React component (using Next.js and client-side rendering) provides a user interface for testing the health and connectivity of backend services such as a database and multiple API endpoints. It allows users (typically admins or developers) to:

- Run a suite of system health tests (database and APIs)
- Monitor the status and result of each test (success, error, warning)
- View execution time and error details
- Get an overall summary of test statuses

---

## Key Features

### 1. Test Execution

- **Manual trigger:** Pressing "Run All Tests" starts testing.
- **Tests performed:**
  - Database Connection (`/api/test/db`)
  - Halaqah API (`/api/halaqah?type=QURAN`)
  - Users API (`/api/users`)
  - Santri API (`/api/santri`)
  - Health Check (`/api/health`)
- **Sequential Execution:** Tests run one after another, updating UI per result.

### 2. Result Display & UX

- **Status Indicators:** Each test shows an icon for its status (success, error, warning), with appropriate color coding and border.
- **Test Message & Details:**
  - Each result displays a human-readable message.
  - Users can expand for technical detail (JSON).
  - Displays the time taken for each test in milliseconds.
- **Summary:** Overview counts of passed, failed, and warning tests after completion.
- **Loading States:** Spinner indicators while tests are running or initializing.
- **Result Management:** "Clear Results" button to reset output.

### 3. Implementation Details

- **State Management:** Uses React `useState` for test results and running status.
- **Error Handling:** Captures and displays test errors with as much detail as possible.
- **Typesafety:** TypeScript interfaces ensure consistent result structure.

### 4. UI Components

- Uses shared UI components: `Card`, `Button` (presumably ChakraUI or custom), and Lucide icons.
- Layout: Clean, organized, with distinct areas for actions, results, and summaries.

## Usage Scenario

Intended as an admin/system health page, it helps operators quickly verify backend connectivity and status via a simple web interface. Upon encountering errors, users can inspect full error details for debugging.

---

## Customization

- **Add More Tests:** Additional API or system checks can be appended to the test array.
- **Visual Look:** Adjust classes/styles for different design systems.
- **Integration:** Fits as an internal dashboard page within a Next.js app.

## Summary

This component serves as a testing dashboard for system health, focusing on clarity and actionable reporting for developers or system admins. It offers interactive test controls, real-time feedback, detailed error reporting, and a responsive summary overview.
