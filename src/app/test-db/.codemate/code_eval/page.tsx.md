# Code Review Report

## Summary

A thorough review of the provided code has been conducted with a focus on:

- Industry standards and best practices
- Code efficiency and optimization
- Error handling and robustness
- Potential errors or pitfalls

This report highlights observations and corrections in the form of **pseudo code** snippets. Only relevant code lines for improvement are shown.

---

## 1. React Key Usage

**Observation:**  
Using the index as a key in `.map((result, index) => ...)` is [anti-pattern in React](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#choosing-the-key) if ordering or dynamic insertion/deletion occurs, as it may lead to state UI bugs.

**Correction:**  
If result names are unique, use `result.name` instead:

```pseudo
In: {results.map((result, index) => (
Replace:
  key={index}
With:
  key={result.name}
))}
```

If not unique, construct unique keys using `name` and possibly an increment or timestamp.

---

## 2. setResults Call Inside Loop (Rendering Optimization)

**Observation:**  
Inside **runAllTests**, `setResults([...testResults]);` is called inside the for loop, causing multiple state updates and re-renders (inefficient).

**Best Practice:**  
Aggregate all test results first, then set state once:

```pseudo
// Before:
for each test in tests:
  push result to testResults
  setResults([...testResults])

// After:
for each test in tests:
  push result to testResults
setResults(testResults)
```

---

## 3. Use of Non-memoized Functions in JSX

**Observation:**  
Functions such as `getStatusIcon` and `getStatusColor` are redefined each render.  
While not severe for small components, memoizing these is better, especially if passed as props or used in deep trees.

**Correction:**  
Wrap these functions in `useCallback` if you pass them as props (not urgent here, but something to keep in mind).

---

## 4. Inconsistent/Improper Nullish Checks

**Observation:**  
Duration rendering:

```jsx
{
  result.duration && <span className="...">{result.duration}ms</span>;
}
```

If `duration` is `0` (test executed instantly), nothing will be rendered because `0` is falsy.

**Correction:**

```pseudo
Replace:
  {result.duration && (<span>...</span>)}
With:
  {typeof result.duration === 'number' && (<span>...</span>)}
```

---

## 5. Type Safety for Error

**Observation:**  
In catch block:

```js
details: error,
```

`error` could be of type `unknown`

**Correction:**

```pseudo
// Optionally, cast or process 'error' to be more informative:
details: error instanceof Error ? error.stack : String(error),
```

Or ensure error serialization is safe if returned to UI.

---

## 6. Fetch Error Handling (Unhandled Response Format)

**Observation:**  
Errors thrown after fetch failures may still return a non-JSON response, which is not handled if later serialized through `JSON.stringify`.

**Correction:**  
Make sure to catch and handle JSON parsing errors:

```pseudo
try:
  json = await response.json()
catch JSON.parse error:
  throw new Error("Response was not valid JSON")
```

---

## 7. Minor Consistency: Async Function Return Types

**Observation:**  
In runTest, the type is loosely inferred.

**Best Practice:**  
Add explicit return type for runTest:

```pseudo
const runTest = async (...): Promise<TestResult> => {...}
```

---

## 8. Accessibility

**Observation:**  
The `<details>` and `<summary>` elements are good, but for better accessibility, consider adding `aria` attributes or more descriptive text.

---

## 9. Button Variant

**Observation:**  
Assumes `"primary"` is a valid variant for the Button.  
Ensure that the `variant` prop is supported by the Button component to avoid runtime errors.

---

## 10. Response Status Codes

**Observation:**  
For each fetch call, you're only checking for `response.ok`. If you want granular control or logging, add logging for non-200 codes or display the exact code in the UI details.

---

## 11. Naming Consistency

**Observation:**  
The message "Test berhasil" and "Test gagal" are in Indonesian, but the rest of the messages/UI are in English.  
For consistency and localization, match the language throughout.

---

## Summary of Corrections (Pseudo code)

```pseudo
// 1. Use stable keys in list rendering
key={result.name}

// 2. Batch state updates for test results
for each test in tests:
  push result to testResults
setResults(testResults)

// 4. Correct duration nullish check
if typeof result.duration === 'number':
  render duration

// 5. Error serialization in details
details: error instanceof Error ? error.stack : String(error),

// 6. JSON parsing error handling in fetch
try:
  result = await response.json()
catch:
  throw new Error("Response was not valid JSON")

// 7. Explicit return type for runTest
const runTest = async (...): Promise<TestResult> => {...}
```

---

## Overall Impression

- The code structure is sound and applies typical React patterns.
- A few optimizations regarding state updates, list rendering keys, and error handling are recommended for better robustness and maintainability.
- No functional errors found, but code can benefit from the above optimizations for **production**-readiness.

**If you implement the above pseudo code corrections, the code will be more optimized, robust, and maintainable according to industry standards.**
