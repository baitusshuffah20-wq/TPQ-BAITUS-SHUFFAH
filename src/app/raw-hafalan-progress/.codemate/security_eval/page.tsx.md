# Security Vulnerabilities Report

**Code Audited:** React Client Component for Raw Hafalan Progress Page  
**Context:** Next.js app with client-side data fetch/seed operations via `/api/raw-hafalan-progress`.

---

## 1. **Lack of Authentication/Authorization**

- **Issue**: The code makes `GET` and `POST` requests to endpoints (`/api/raw-hafalan-progress`) that, if not protected server-side, could allow any client (regardless of their permissions) to check and seed sensitive data.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized users may read or modify potentially sensitive data.
- **Recommendation**: Require **authentication** (e.g., session, JWT) and enforce **authorization** checks on the API endpoints (NOT in this code, but must be mentioned here because the client assumes endpoints are safe).

---

## 2. **Lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection**

- **Issue**: The `handleSeed` function sends a `POST` request without any CSRF token or protection.
- **Impact**: If the endpoint is not protected, an attacker could trick a user's browser into executing unwanted actions on their behalf.
- **Recommendation**: Use CSRF tokens for state-changing requests. Ensure the server endpoint rejects requests lacking a valid CSRF token.

---

## 3. **Handling of Untrusted User Input**

- **Issue**: The component renders data received from the API (e.g., `record.santriName`, `record.surahName`, `result.message`, etc.) directly into the DOM.
- **Impact**: If the backend fails to sanitize/marshal its outputs, and "dangerous" content is injected (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`), this can cause **XSS (Cross Site Scripting)**.
- **Mitigation here**: React escapes output by default, so direct XSS via variable interpolation is prevented unless `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used.
- **Concerns**:
  - If the data ever moves to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, or Reactâ€™s escaping is accidentally bypassed, XSS is possible.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure the backend API **sanitizes all outgoing data**, and never pass untrusted user content to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

---

## 4. **Verbose Error Disclosure**

- **Issue**: API errors (including stack traces, error messages, and possibly implementation details) are printed directly to the user interface using:
  ```tsx
  <pre className="...">{data.error}</pre>
  ```
- **Impact**: This can leak sensitive server-side information (e.g., file paths, SQL statements, framework versions), which can facilitate further attacks.
- **Recommendation**: Sanitize and generalize error messages before displaying. Avoid rendering raw error details/UI stack traces to non-admin users.

---

## 5. **Potential Server-Side Raw SQL Vulnerability**

- **Issue**: The page mentions "raw SQL queries to check and seed hafalan progress data."
- **Impact**: If any client input is ever sent (even accidentally) that influences the SQL query **without parameterization**, this may enable **SQL Injection**.
- **Mitigation Here**: This component does not accept or send data from the user, only calls the endpoint.
- **Key Point**: If endpoints later accept user input, server code must rigorously parameterize queries.

---

## 6. **No Rate Limiting / Abuse Protection (UI-side Non-Issue, but Worth Mentioning)**

- **Issue**: The "Seed Hafalan Progress Data" button can be clicked repeatedly, making a `POST` each time.
- **Impact**: If the API does not implement rate limiting, it may allow spam/DoS via client-side abuse.
- **Recommendation**: Have server endpoints implement **rate limiting** and **abuse detection** for sensitive operations.

---

## 7. **No HTTPS Enforcement**

- **Note**: UI-side cannot enforce HTTPS, but API must be served over HTTPS to prevent interception/tampering.
- **Recommendation**: Enforce HTTPS on all connections.

| ------------------------- | --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Missing AuthZ/AuthN       | API endpoints         | High     | Require authentication & authorization                       |
| CSRF                      | POST `/api/...` calls | High     | Implement CSRF tokens                                        |
| User Data Rendering (XSS) | React component       | Medium   | Sanitize backend output, don't use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` |
| Error Disclosure          | Error UI              | Medium   | Show generic errors, avoid stack traces                      |
| Raw SQL Mentioned (SQLi)  | API implementation    | Critical | Parameterize queries, never interpolate input                |
| Rate Limiting             | API                   | Medium   | Enforce via backend, especially for POST                     |
| HTTPS Enforcement         | Deployment            | High     | Serve only over HTTPS                                        |

## **Conclusion**

**The major security risks here depend on how the `/api/raw-hafalan-progress` endpoints are implemented and protected.**  
This React component does not itself introduce severe security holes, but it **assumes the backend is robustly secure**. Careful attention is required server-side to prevent AuthZ/AuthN bypass, CSRF, information disclosure, SQLi, and abuse.

**No code changes to this component are required unless dangerous rendering methods are adopted, but backend and API security must be prioritized.**
