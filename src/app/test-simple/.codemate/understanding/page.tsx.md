High-Level Documentation: TestSimplePage Component

**Overview:**
The TestSimplePage component is a simple, client-side React functional component intended for a Next.js application. It serves as a minimal test or diagnostic page to verify the proper functionality of a Next.js setup.

**Key Features:**

- **Centered Card Layout:** The main content is displayed inside a centered, styled card with a white background, rounded corners, padding, and shadow.
- **Status Information:** The card displays a heading ("Test Simple Page") and a short description. Below, it lists:
  - A "Status" indicator showing if the page is working (hardcoded as âœ… Working).
  - The current date and time, dynamically generated on each render.
  - The current environment (from process.env.NODE_ENV or defaults to "development").
- **Interactive Button:** A "Test Button" is provided. Clicking it triggers a simple alert dialog.
- **Navigation Link:** A link at the bottom allows users to navigate back to the homepage.

**Styling:**

- Uses utility-first CSS classes (likely from Tailwind CSS) for consistent spacing, typography, colors, and interactive states.

**Intended Use:**

- Quick validation that client-side rendering, environment variables, and basic interactivity work in the deployed or local environment.
- Can be used as a template for simple status or diagnostic pages in Next.js projects.
