# Security Vulnerabilities Report

This analysis reviews the provided code **strictly for security vulnerabilities**. Below are the identified security concerns, the risks they pose, code references, and recommendations for mitigation.

---

### 1. **Unsanitized Rendering of External Data (QR Code Image)**

**Code Reference:**

```tsx
{
  paymentInstructions.qrCode && (
    <div className="text-center">
      <label className="text-sm text-gray-600">QR Code</label>
      <div className="mt-2 inline-block p-4 bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 rounded-lg">
        <img
          src={paymentInstructions.qrCode}
          alt="QR Code"
          className="w-48 h-48 mx-auto"
        />
      </div>
      <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-2">
        Scan dengan aplikasi pembayaran Anda
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Vulnerability:**  
The `src` attribute for the `<img />` tag is directly set from external data (`paymentInstructions.qrCode`). If an attacker can control this field on the server response, it opens the possibility for XSS attacks (via `javascript:` URLs in some browsers, or `data:` URLs with unwanted content), or leaking credentials via crafted URLs.

**Risk:** High if the backend is not properly sanitizing and validating the format of `qrCode`.

**Mitigation:**

- Ensure `paymentInstructions.qrCode` only contains safe, trusted URLs or data URIs (ideally, base64-encoded images).
- Validate and sanitize the QR code URL on the backend before sending it to the client.
- Consider restricting URLs to a domain you control.

---

### 2. **Use of Window/Navigator APIs for Copy and Share**

#### a) Clipboard (Copy to Clipboard)

**Code Reference:**

```tsx
const copyToClipboard = (text: string, label: string) => {
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
  toast.success(`${label} berhasil disalin`);
};
```

**Vulnerability:**

- **No input validation:** User-controllable data is copied to the clipboard. If user input influences this, it can be abused to put malicious content into the clipboard (see also [Clipboard poisoning](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Clipboard_Poisoning)).

**Risk:** Generally low, but can be abused for social engineering, especially if attackers can influence the copied text.

**Mitigation:**

- Sanitize data before copying, especially if user input reaches this point.
- Limit what information can be copied to the clipboard.

#### b) Web Share API

**Code Reference:**

```tsx
if (navigator.share) {
  navigator.share({
    title: "Instruksi Pembayaran",
    text: `Pembayaran ${formatCurrency(paymentInstructions.amount)} - Order ID: ${paymentInstructions.orderId}`,
    url: window.location.href,
  });
} else {
  copyToClipboard(window.location.href, "Link instruksi");
}
```

**Vulnerability:**

- **No input validation:** If `paymentInstructions.amount` or `.orderId` are attacker-controlled, there may be a risk of pasting malicious or misleading content.

**Mitigation:**

- Sanitize all data interpolated into the shared message.

---

### 3. **Leakage of Sensitive Order Information in URLs**

**Code Reference:**

```tsx
const response = await fetch(
  `/api/payment/instructions?orderId=${orderId}&paymentId=${paymentId}`,
);
...
const response = await fetch(
  `/api/payment/status?orderId=${orderId}&paymentId=${paymentId}`,
);
```

**Vulnerability:**  
The `orderId` and `paymentId` are extracted from URL query parameters (`useSearchParams()`). If sensitive, they can be logged in browser history, proxies, server logs, etc.

**Risk:** Medium. Exposure of order/payment identifiers can lead to enumeration, unauthorized access, or leakage.

**Mitigation:**

- Avoid exposing sensitive IDs in URL query params; consider using POST and HTTP-only cookies or sessions.
- Use opaque, unpredictable identifiers (UUIDs, tokens).
- Always verify on the server side that the authenticated user is authorized to access the referenced order/payment.

---

### 4. **Race and Enumeration Conditions (API Returns and Status Checks)**

**Vulnerability:**

- **Order/payment status APIs are queryable via user-supplied IDs.** There are no client-side protections or rate limits shown, so an attacker could automate status checks (or brute-force valid IDs if they are predictable).

**Risk:** Medium to high, depending on server protections.

**Mitigation:**

- Enforce server-side authorization and rate limiting.
- Ensure IDs are not predictable.
- Monitor and alert on unusual API traffic.

---

### 5. **Potential XSS in Displayed Instructions**

**Code Reference:**

```tsx
{
  paymentInstructions.instructions.map((instruction, index) => (
    <div key={index} className="flex items-start gap-3">
      ...
      <p className="text-gray-700">{instruction}</p>
    </div>
  ));
}
```

**Vulnerability:**

- **No sanitization on output:** If the `instructions` array contains HTML (e.g., `<img onerror="alert(1)">`), this could result in XSS if React's escaping is bypassed or if dangerouslySetInnerHTML is ever used later.

**Risk:** Low (because React escapes strings by default), but worth noting: **never render untrusted HTML using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` here.**

**Mitigation:**

- Keep instructions as plain text; do NOT render as HTML.

---

### 6. **No CSRF Protection on API Routes**

**Vulnerability:**

- The fetch calls for `/api/payment/instructions` and `/api/payment/status` are GET requests and may be susceptible to CSRF if these endpoints have critical effects or return sensitive data.

**Risk:** Low to medium, depending on backend protections.

**Mitigation:**

- For any sensitive operations, require CSRF tokens (though GET is generally considered safe, don't return sensitive data without authentication).
- Protect API endpoints on the server.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability Area             | Risk    | Mitigation                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Unsanitized QR code image URLs | High    | Sanitize, restrict, and validate image URLs    |
| Clipboard/Web Share input      | Low-Med | Sanitize text, restrict content                |
| Exposure of IDs in URL         | Medium  | Do not expose; use POST, tokens, opaque IDs    |
| API brute-force/enumeration    | Medium  | Rate limiting, authorization, unguessable IDs  |
| Potential instruction XSS      | Low     | Ensure text, never use dangerouslySetInnerHTML |
| CSRF on API endpoints          | Low-Med | Use CSRF tokens, authenticate all API calls    |

---

## **Recommendations**

- **Validate and sanitize all external data**, especially URLs and text displayed or injected into the DOM.
- **Avoid exposing sensitive identifiers** (orderId, paymentId) in URLs. If necessary, ensure they are cryptographically strong and not guessable.
- **Protect API endpoints** with authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
- **Never use user-supplied HTML without proper sanitization.**
- **Limit and validate clipboard and sharing operations** to avoid information leakage or social engineering.

_No obvious direct code execution vulnerabilities (such as injection or dangerous eval) were found, but robust backend protections and careful input handling are essential to prevent exploitation of the above risks._
