# Payment Instructions Page â€” High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This React (Next.js) component renders a detailed payment instructions page. It allows a user to view and interact with the instructions necessary to complete a payment for an order, including time limits, payment details, payment method-specific instructions, and action buttons for copying, printing, sharing, and checking payment status.

## Key Features and Workflow

### 1. **Parameter Detection & Data Loading**

- Fetches `orderId` and `paymentId` from URL query parameters.
- If missing, redirects to the main payment page.
- Loads payment instructions asynchronously from `/api/payment/instructions`.
- On load failure, shows error and redirects.

### 2. **Payment Countdown Timer**

- Displays a real-time countdown to the payment expiry time.
- Automatically updates every second; shows "Expired" when time is up.

### 3. **Payment Details & Actions**

- Shows:
  - Order ID (with copy-to-clipboard)
  - Amount (formatted as currency)
  - Virtual Account number or QR code (if applicable, with copy/scan feature)
  - Payment method icon and name
- Instructions for payment, shown as a step-by-step list.

### 4. **Status Checking**

- "Check Status" button verifies payment status via `/api/payment/status`.
- If paid, redirects to a payment success page; otherwise, notifies user.

### 5. **User Guidance**

- An "Important Notes" section highlights critical payment tips and support info.

### 6. **Utility Actions**

- Print the payment instructions.
- Share them via browser share or by copying the link.
