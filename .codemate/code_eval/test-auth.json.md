# Software Code Review Report

## Code Provided

```json
{
  "email": "bapak.ahmad@gmail.com",
  "password": "wali123",
  "deviceId": "test-device-123",
  "deviceType": "android",
  "fcmToken": "test-fcm-token"
}
```

## Critical Review

### 1. Hardcoded Sensitive Information

- **Issue:** The `password` is present in plaintext within the code or configuration, which is a serious security risk and a violation of industry best practices.
- **Recommendation:** Never hardcode sensitive credentials such as passwords or tokens. Use environment variables, secure vaults, or encrypted secrets management.

#### Suggested Correction (Pseudo Code):

```pseudo
// Remove the password field, or read it securely at runtime, e.g.:
"password": getPasswordFromSecureSource()
```

---

### 2. Hardcoded Test Data

- **Issue:** All fields contain test or development data (`test-device-123`, `test-fcm-token`, etc.) which should not be present in production or shared repositories.
- **Recommendation:** Use mock or anonymized data for development, and parameterize such values for different environments.

#### Suggested Correction (Pseudo Code):

```pseudo
"deviceId": getDeviceIdFromEnvironment(),
"fcmToken": getFcmTokenFromEnvironment(),
```

---

### 3. Lack of Input Validation

- **Issue:** There's no indication that email formats, password strength, or deviceId/deviceType fields are validated before use.
- **Recommendation:** Always validate user inputs before processing or storing them.

#### Suggested Correction (Pseudo Code):

```pseudo
if not isValidEmail(email):
    throw InvalidInputError("Invalid email format")

if not isValidPassword(password):
    throw InvalidInputError("Insecure password")

if not isValidDeviceId(deviceId):
    throw InvalidInputError("Invalid device ID")

if deviceType not in ["android", "ios"]:
    throw InvalidInputError("Invalid device type")
```

---

### 4. No Encryption or Secure Handling

- **Issue:** Sensitive values such as emails, passwords, and tokens are not encrypted or hashed.
- **Recommendation:** Never store or transmit plain text passwords or tokens. Use secure channels (TLS/HTTPS) and encrypt or hash sensitive data.

#### Suggested Correction (Pseudo Code):

```pseudo
transmitOverSecureChannel(serialize(data))
data["password"] = hashPassword(password)
```

### Summary Checklist

| Issue                         | Recommendation                                  | Severity |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Hardcoded sensitive info      | Remove/hide/secure passwords/tokens             | Critical |
| Hardcoded test data           | Parameterize, use environment variables         | Major    |
| Lack of input validation      | Implement validation before use                 | Major    |
| No encryption/secure handling | Hash/encrypt sensitive info, use secure channel | Critical |

---

## Final Recommendations

- Remove all hardcoded, sensitive data from the codebase.
- Securely handle passwords and tokens.
- Implement proper input validation prior to any processing or storage.
- Adopt environment-variable-based configuration for all environment-dependent values.
- Follow industry standards for secrets management and secure coding practices.
