**High-Level Documentation**

This code defines a configuration object for a tool or process that uses plugins. Specifically, it specifies the use of the "@tailwindcss/postcss" plugin by listing it in the plugins array. The configuration object is then exported as the default export of the module, making it available for use elsewhere in the project. This setup is commonly found in a frontend build or styling pipeline, facilitating the integration of Tailwind CSS with PostCSS.
