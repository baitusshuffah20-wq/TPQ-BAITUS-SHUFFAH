# High-level Documentation

## Overview

This code is a Node.js script that executes a TypeScript seed file for initializing or populating a theme in a database, likely using Prisma ORM, by invoking the corresponding seeding script via a shell command.

## Key Steps

1. **Child Process Creation**: The script uses Node.jsâ€™s built-in child_process module to create a new process, allowing it to run shell commands from within JavaScript.
2. **Seeding Execution**: It runs the command:
   ```
   npx ts-node --compiler-options {"module":"CommonJS"} prisma/seed-theme.ts
   ```
   This command executes the TypeScript file prisma/seed-theme.ts using ts-node, specifying the CommonJS module system for compatibility.
3. **Output Handling**:
   - If an error occurs during execution, the script logs the error message and stops.
   - If there is any output in the standard error stream, it logs that and stops.
   - If the command runs successfully, it outputs the standard output to the console.

## Purpose

This script automates the process of running a database seed script (specifically, for themes), handling output and potential errors, to facilitate easy and reliable database initialization or test data insertion during development or deployment.
