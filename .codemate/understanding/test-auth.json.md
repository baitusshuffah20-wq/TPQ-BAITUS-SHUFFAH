High-Level Documentation

Overview:
This code sample represents a JSON object used for user authentication and device registration within a mobile or web application.

Fields:

- email: The user’s email address for login credentials.
- password: The user’s password associated with their account.
- deviceId: A unique identifier representing the device from which the user is logging in (e.g., a UUID string).
- deviceType: Specifies the device’s platform, such as "android" (or could be "ios", etc.).
- fcmToken: The Firebase Cloud Messaging token, used to enable push notifications and communication with the device.

Intended Usage:
This JSON object would typically be sent from a client application (such as a mobile app) to a backend server API endpoint as part of a login or device registration request. The server uses this data to authenticate the user, register the device for push notifications, and track active user sessions per device.

Security Considerations:

- Password and sensitive data should be transmitted over secure (HTTPS) connections.
- Device and FCM tokens should be validated and managed carefully to ensure secure and accurate device-user binding.

Typical Flow:

1. User attempts to log in via the app.
2. The app collects user credentials and device info, then packages them into this JSON structure.
3. The JSON is sent to the backend authentication API.
4. The backend validates credentials, saves/updates device info, and issues authentication tokens or session data in response.
