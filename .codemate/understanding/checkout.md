# PublicLayout Component - High-Level Documentation

## Overview

The `PublicLayout` component is a reusable layout module for public-facing pages in a React application. It provides a consistent structure across pages by including a navigation bar at the top and a footer at the bottom, with dynamic content rendered in between.

## Structure

- **Navbar:** Incorporates a shared `PublicNavbar` component at the top.
- **Main Content:** Renders whatever is passed as children within a flexible main area, allowing for additional styling via an optional `className` prop.
- **Footer:** Displays a shared `PublicFooter` component at the bottom.

## Props

- **children (React.ReactNode):** Main content to display between the navbar and footer.
- **className (optional string):** Extra CSS classes to apply styling to the main content area.

## Usage

Wrap your public page components with `PublicLayout` to maintain UI consistency across your application's public sections.

**In summary:**  
`PublicLayout` standardizes public page structure by sandwiching page-specific content between a navbar and footer, aiding in consistent page design and reducing repetitive layout code.
