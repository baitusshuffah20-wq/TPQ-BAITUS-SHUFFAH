**High-Level Documentation**

**Purpose:**  
This file is a TypeScript declaration file automatically generated or required by Next.js projects configured with TypeScript. It ensures type-safe code by informing TypeScript about types specific to the Next.js environment.

**Key Features:**

- References Next.js-specific types for both general server/client operations and image imports.
- Should not be manually edited, as per the guidance and official documentation. Next.js manages its configuration and updates as necessary.

**Relevant Documentation:**
