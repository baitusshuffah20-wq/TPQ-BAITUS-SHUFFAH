# High-Level Documentation: XAMPP Backup Script (PowerShell)

## Overview

This PowerShell script is designed to assist users in safely updating their XAMPP installation by automating the process of backing up both web project files and MySQL databases. It also provides clear post-backup instructions for restoring data after the XAMPP update.

---

## Main Features & Workflow

1. **Configuration Setup**
   - Defines paths for backup destination, XAMPP installation, the specific project directory, and MySQL binaries/data location.
   - Configures MySQL credentials.

2. **Backup Directory Creation**
   - Creates a uniquely timestamped backup folder on the Desktop.
   - Organizes subfolders for project files and database dumps.

3. **Project File Backup**
   - Copies the entire contents of the specified project directory (e.g., a folder in `htdocs`) into the backup location.

4. **Database Detection & Backup**
   - Identifies all MySQL database folders under `xampp\mysql\data`, excluding system databases (e.g., mysql, performance_schema).
   - For each database:
     - Executes `mysqldump` to export the database as an SQL file into the backup.
     - Handles optional MySQL password as needed.
     - Reports success or failure for each backup operation.

5. **README Generation**
   - Creates a `README.txt` file in the backup folder containing:
     - Backup timestamp and included data.
     - Step-by-step restore instructions for both project files and databases.
     - Notes about ensuring XAMPP services are running and configuration checks after restoration.

6. **User Guidance & Next Steps**
   - Notifies the user about backup completion and the backup folderâ€™s location.
   - Presents sequential steps for safely updating XAMPP and restoring backup data.
   - Pauses for user confirmation before script exit.

## Usage Scenario

- Run this script **before updating XAMPP** to automatically back up essential web projects and databases.
- After updating XAMPP, follow the provided README instructions to restore projects and databases.

---

## Customization

- Project and XAMPP paths, as well as MySQL credentials, can be edited at the top of the script to match your environment.
- Additional folders can be backed up by extending the project backup section.

---

## Safety & Considerations

- Selectively avoids system databases in MySQL backup.
- Reports the status of each backup operation.
- Ensures user is guided with color-coded command-line messages for clarity.

**In summary:**  
_The script provides a safe, structured, and user-friendly way to back up XAMPP web projects and MySQL databases, readying them for restoration after a platform upgrade._
