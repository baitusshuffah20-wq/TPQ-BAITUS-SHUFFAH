# High-Level Documentation

This code provides a configuration for ESLint, tailored for a TypeScript project using Next.js and Prettier for consistent code formatting. It leverages the new flat config API (`tseslint.config`), combining configurations and rules from several popular tools and plugins.

**Key Features:**

1. **Base ESLint Rules**:  
   Starts from recommended ESLint rules for JavaScript code quality.

2. **TypeScript Support**:  
   Augments with TypeScript ESLint recommended rules for static type checking and code standards in TypeScript codebases.

3. **Next.js Integration**:
   - Enables the Next.js ESLint plugin.
   - Applies both the recommended Next.js code quality rules and performance-focused "core-web-vitals" rules to help detect issues specific to Next.js apps.

4. **Prettier Integration**:
   - Adds the Prettier plugin for automatic and consistent code formatting.
   - Enforces Prettier's formatting as an ESLint rule (causing lint errors on format violations).
   - Configures Prettier to handle line endings automatically.

5. **Custom Rules**:
   - Enforces no unused variables in TypeScript files as errors.
   - Warns on the use of any in TypeScript code to encourage type safety.

**Usage Context:**  
This configuration is intended for projects using Next.js with TypeScript and Prettier, providing a modern, opinionated linting setup that promotes best practices, code quality, and consistency.
