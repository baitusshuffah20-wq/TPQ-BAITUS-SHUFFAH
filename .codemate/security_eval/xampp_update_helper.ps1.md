# Security Vulnerabilities Report

**Subject**: PowerShell Script for XAMPP Data Backup  
**Date**: 2024-06

---

## Summary

This report reviews the provided PowerShell script for XAMPP backup activities, focusing solely on security vulnerabilities. The analysis identifies direct and indirect risks that may expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized code execution. Only issues related to security are addressed—functionality and general coding issues are left out.

## Vulnerability List

### 1. Plaintext MySQL Credentials

**Code**:

```powershell
$mysqlUser = "root"
$mysqlPassword = ""  # Sesuaikan dengan password MySQL Anda jika ada
```

- **Issue**: The script requires storing MySQL credentials, including the password, in plaintext within the script file. This is insecure, especially if the script is left on disk or sent through unsecured channels.
- **Risk**: Credentials could be read by any user with access to the script, dumped in memory, or included in accidental commit to version control.

**Recommendation**:  
Do not hardcode credentials. Fetch them at runtime using `Read-Host -AsSecureString`, Windows Credential Manager, or environment variables with appropriate access controls.

---

### 2. Shell Command Injection via Invoke-Expression

**Code**:

```powershell
$mysqldumpCmd = """$mysqlBinPath\mysqldump.exe"" --user=$mysqlUser --databases $db --result-file=""$outputFile"""
...
Invoke-Expression $mysqldumpCmd
```

- **Issue**: `Invoke-Expression` is inherently dangerous when combined with variables that can be influenced by external input (e.g., database names, paths). If any folders or database names are maliciously named (e.g., containing command delimiters or PowerShell code), this method may allow arbitrary code execution.
- **Risk**: Attacker with permissions to create folders or databases on the system may inject commands.

**Recommendation**:  
Avoid `Invoke-Expression`. Instead, use `Start-Process` or directly call the executable with parameter arrays. Always properly quote and escape any user-controllable input.

---

### 3. Use of Default MySQL User (`root`) with No Password

**Code**:

```powershell
$mysqlUser = "root"
$mysqlPassword = ""
...
# Used for backup via mysqldump
```

- **Issue**: The script assumes root access to MySQL with no password. This is extremely insecure; any process or user executing this script will operate with full database privileges, and the database itself is highly vulnerable to unauthorized local or remote access.
- **Risk**: Complete data compromise, privilege escalation, database integrity loss.

**Recommendation**:  
Never use the `root` user for application/backups scripts. Use minimally-privileged, password-protected MySQL accounts with access only to required databases.

---

### 4. Credential Leakage in Command-Line Arguments

**Code**:

```powershell
--user=$mysqlUser --password=$mysqlPassword
```

- **Issue**: When running the mysqldump process, the password is supplied as a command line argument. This exposes the password in plaintext to any user on the system who can view running processes (e.g., via Task Manager or `Get-Process`).
- **Risk**: Attackers can easily harvest credentials without accessing the script file itself.

**Recommendation**:  
Use `--defaults-extra-file` with temporary, access-limited files for credentials or rely on MySQL’s secure credential storage options.

---

### 5. Insecure Temporary File and Directory Handling

**Code**:

```powershell
$backupDir = "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\XAMPP_Backup_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss')"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $backupDir -Force | Out-Null
```

- **Issue**: The script creates backup folders and files in the user’s desktop directory, which may be world-readable in some configurations, insecurely shared, or accessible in the event of malware or local attacks.
- **Risk**: Backed-up data (including sensitive project code and database contents) may be stolen or tampered with by other users or processes.

**Recommendation**:  
Store backups in access-restricted directories. Set appropriate NTFS permissions to safeguard sensitive folders or use an encrypted location.

---

### 6. Lack of Data Integrity / Tamper Protection

- **Issue**: The script creates SQL and project backup files but doesn’t implement any checks (e.g., hashing, signing) to verify backup data has not been altered or replaced in transit.
- **Risk**: Attackers could tamper with the backup, inject malicious code or replace data, leading to further compromise upon restoration.

**Recommendation**:  
Generate hashes (e.g., SHA256) of the backup files and store them securely for verification. Consider adding signatures if backups are transferred or stored off-device.

| #   | Vulnerability                                  | Risk                     | Recommendation                     |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 1   | Plaintext credentials in script                | Credential leakage       | Use secure credential storage      |
| 2   | Use of Invoke-Expression (code injection risk) | Arbitrary code execution | Use Start-Process, avoid IE        |
| 3   | Use of MySQL root with no password             | Full DB compromise       | Use restricted user, set password  |
| 4   | Password in command-line arguments             | Credential leakage       | Use my.cnf files or secure creds   |
| 5   | Insecure backup locations                      | Data exposure            | Use restricted/encrypted dirs      |
| 6   | No data integrity/ tamper checking             | Backup tampering risk    | Implement hash or signature checks |

## Final Notes

**The script, as designed, works for its basic backup purpose but exposes multiple severe security risks**. For any environment beyond private, personal development with no sensitive data, remediations described above are mandatory to prevent unauthorized access, data theft, and privilege abuse.

**IMPORTANT**: All recommendations should be implemented and verified before deploying or distributing this script further.
