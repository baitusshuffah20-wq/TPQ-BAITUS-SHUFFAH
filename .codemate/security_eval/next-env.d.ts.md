# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Analyzed

```typescript
/// <reference types="next" />

## Overview

The provided code consists solely of TypeScript reference directives and a comment. There is no executable or business logic code present.

---

## Security Vulnerability Assessment

### Findings

**1. Reference Directives**

- The code includes reference types for `next` and `next/image-types/global`. These are standard TypeScript directives that provide type definitions for the Next.js framework and image components. They do **not** execute any code and do not interact with external sources at runtime.

**2. Comments**

- The comments are informative and do not contain or cause any side effects.

**3. No Business or Application Logic**

- There are no functions, imports, conditional statements, data operations, or any other executable code constructs.

---

## Conclusion

**No security vulnerabilities were found** in the provided code.

- The file is only used for TypeScript type referencing and documentation purposes.
- There are no possible attack vectors, data flows, or unsafe operations contained within this code segment.

---

## Recommendations

- Continue to ensure that TypeScript configuration and type reference files are not used to inject or execute application logic.
- Always keep external type packages (like @types/next) up to date to prevent potential issues caused by vulnerabilities in type definition packages themselves, even though such risks are minimal.
- Review actual business logic and configuration files for further security assessment.
