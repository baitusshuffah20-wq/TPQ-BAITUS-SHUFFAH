# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Analyzed

```json
{
  "email": "bapak.ahmad@gmail.com",
  "password": "wali123",
  "deviceId": "test-device-123",
  "deviceType": "android",
  "fcmToken": "test-fcm-token"
}
```

## Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials

- **Description**: The JSON contains a plaintext password field: `"password": "wali123"`.
- **Risk**: Hardcoding credentials exposes sensitive information and can be accidentally leaked through source code repositories, logs, or other avenues.
- **Impact**: Attackers who gain access to this code can easily extract the password, compromising accounts and system security.
- **Recommendation**: Never hardcode passwords or sensitive credentials. Use environment variables or secure credential management systems.

### 2. Sensitive Data Exposure

- **Description**: The email, password, and FCM token are present in plaintext.
- **Risk**: If this JSON is transmitted or stored insecurely (e.g., over HTTP, in logs, or unsecured storage), sensitive information could be intercepted.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to accounts, privacy violations, and potential for further compromise using device and token information.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure all sensitive data is:
  - Transmitted only over secure channels (TLS/HTTPS).
  - Never logged or printed in application logs.
  - Properly encrypted at rest and in transit.

### 3. Predictable Device Identifiers

- **Description**: `"deviceId": "test-device-123"` uses a predictable value.
- **Risk**: Using predictable device IDs can allow attackers to impersonate devices or carry out device-related attacks.
- **Impact**: Possibility of unauthorized device registration, spoofing, or replay attacks.
- **Recommendation**: Use randomly generated, securely stored device identifiers.

### 4. No Evidence of Rate Limiting or Anti-Brute Force

- **Description**: If this JSON is used as part of an authentication or registration workflow, there is no indication of controls against brute force or automated attacks.
- **Risk**: Attackers may attempt credential stuffing or brute force attacks.
- **Impact**: Account compromise, denial of service.
- **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting, account lockout policies, and monitoring.

### 5. FCM Token Security

- **Description**: `"fcmToken": "test-fcm-token"` is presented in plaintext.
- **Risk**: If mishandled, an attacker could abuse the FCM token to send unauthorized notifications or intercept messages.
- **Impact**: Privacy and security of messages are compromised.
- **Recommendation**: Treat FCM tokens as sensitive. Never expose them unnecessarily and secure their transmission/storage.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability             | Risk           | Recommendation                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Hardcoded credentials     | Severe         | Remove from code; use environment/configuration |
| Sensitive data exposure   | High           | Always use HTTPS; never log sensitive values    |
| Predictable device IDs    | Medium         | Use random values for device IDs                |
| No brute force protection | Medium to High | Add rate limiting, lockouts, monitoring         |
| FCM token exposure        | Medium         | Securely handle and store tokens                |

## Overall Recommendations

- **Never hardcode or log sensitive credentials**.
- **Always enforce secure transmission (HTTPS/TLS)** for all sensitive operations.
- Use **random, unpredictable values** for identifiers and tokens.
- Protect APIs from **brute-force and automated attacks**.
- Regularly **review and audit** code for sensitive data handling.
